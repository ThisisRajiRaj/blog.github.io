    There is a set of standard formulas for most Indian recipes. Let's with one
    of the simplest curries you can make - <em>yellow dal tadka</em>.
    You sauté chopped onions on a sizzling stove, add chopped tomatoes and fry
    them together, fragrant steam rising off the hot pan and the juices of
    tomatoes sputtering on the surface. Then you add lentils, water, turmeric,
    chili powder, salt. If you have aromatics - like cumin powder or coriander
    powder - this is a good time to add them too. Then you cook the lentils
    until they turn soft. You could now garnish the dish with some lemon juice
    and roasted seasonings like garam masala, red chilies, mustard seeds and
    cumin seeds.

    If you want to make <em>channa masala</em> - a tangy and spicy chickpea
    curry - it is very much the same recipe. Start with a base of sauteed
    onions and tomatoes. Then add turmeric for color, chilli powder for heat.
    Some salt and masalas. Cook the beans and garnish at the end. There is
    always something for saltiness, something for tang, something for spice,
    and something for aroma. Some veggies and protein, and you are done. There
    is an order in which the ingredients have to go in too. Start with the
    onions and tomatoes first and sauté them well before anything else, for
    example.

    It was my mother-in-law who taught me that there is a method to Indian
    cooking. Indian cuisine - like, I am guessing, other cuisines too - is not
    just a smorgasbord of random, disparate recipes. There is a technique to
    it, and it was my mother-in-law who showed me that secret. She taught me systems, optimizations, and formulas. 
    She helped me understand how to sequence my
    cooking so that I would end up with the fewest number of utensils to wash
    after. She taught me how to parallel-process when I cooked: what I should
    start cooking on the stove as I took time to wash and peel and chop veggies. She taught me that adding was easier than
    subtracting; you could add more salt to a dish afterward but taking out
    excess was more difficult. She taught me that dishes had a handful of
    templates that you could customize with different veggies and beans.
</p>
<p>
    My mother-in-law was a teacher by profession. She taught me the fundamentals first, and she taught me well. So, even though I was a zero
    in cooking when she started instructing me, I ended up learning enough to
    get by when my husband and I moved to the United States.

    Today, after a hard day's work, I love getting in the warmth of my kitchen.
    I light a few lemon-scented candles on my countertop, take out my chef's knife and my
    cutting board. I turn on some Eric Satie on our speakers. As I begin to peel
    the dry orange skin of carrots and chop onions into tiny pieces, their
    pungent juices tickling my nostrils, I begin to breathe slow and easy. I
    feel the roughness of the potatoes I wash in my hands. I smell the earthiness of the
    cilantro as I chop them. Cooking, to me, is therapeutic. It is an
    art. As I assemble my dish, I sometimes let my mind wander freely. Free of
    recipes and accumulated knowledge. I experiments with herbs and
    ingredients, things I feel in a corner of my mind would enhance flavors
    even though I don't know for sure. In that way, cooking is like writing or
    painting. You start writing words on a page, not knowing yet where your pen
    will take you. You dip your paintbrush into pots of color without fully
    knowing what the product will look like. But I also know - subliminally now
    - what my mother-in-law taught me about systems and sequences and
    optimizations. I work methodically, in a way that would make my
    mother-in-law proud.
</p>
<p>
    Cooking is also very much like coding or photography or leadership. There
    is so much art in each of them. A lot of what you do is instinctive, drawn
    from your subconscious, from your inner well of creativity. But there is
    also a lot of "science" behind them. My mother-in-law passed on to me some
    of the science behind cooking. Coding has its patterns and anti-patterns
    that get passed on (and discovered with every new paradigm of expression) as well.
    But if give two engineers the same problem to solve, the odds are that they will
    solve it in slightly - and sometimes not so slightly -  different ways. Coding is
    an art AND a science. There are a ton of do's and don't's you get taught in
    leadership, but you discover very soon as a leader that leadership is
    indeed an art.
</p>
<p>
    And that's what I love about all these endeavors. A good dish - like good
    code, good photography, and good leadership - is part art and part science.
    Part logic, part intuition. This is what makes them all challenging as well
    as interesting. You use systems and known formulas, but also a dash of creativity to
    produce work that is beautiful, elegant, and functional. 
</p>
<p>Work that makes you happy is work you can use all your talents in. 
    It is work that brings you joy, and takes you out of all the stresses of the world. To me, I get to
    use many types of faculties in the work I enjoy doing - whether is coding, management, cooking, writing, 
    or photography. So if you ever want to try your hand at any of these, go ahead and do so. You might find 
    your inspiration and joy in some of them as well.
