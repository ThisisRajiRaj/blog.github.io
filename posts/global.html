            About three years ago, I was in a quandary. I was an Engineering
            Director for a service that I loved. I had been sponsoring and
            building that service within my organization from when it had just
            half a dev on it. From when it was not even a service, just a bunch
            of data dumped into a spreadsheet that we emailed to our customers.
            The team and the service had grown, and our customers were loving
            it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was at this time, due to some organizational changes too boring
            to get into in this blog post, I was looking for a new role. Many
            of you have asked me how I know it is time to look for a new role.
            I have told you in the past that I reflect on four things about my
            situation:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Am I learning new things in the current role?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Am I working with people I respect and enjoy working with?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Am I making a meaningful difference with the tech I am building?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Am I feeling good about my career prospects?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            In this case, some of these things checked out and some didn't. So
            I started looking for something new. Thankfully, Microsoft is a
            place where opportunities are plentiful. I had the privilege to
            talk to many teams and VPs. Finally, I settled on a role in the
            Azure team. The opportunity in front of me was to bring a brand-new
            Azure service to life. Learning to build startups inside larger
            companies had become something of a passion for me and this fit the
            bill.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            The service we were to build was to be used by developers and IT
            Professionals around the world to test quickly and efficiently. It would help them stay confident
            that their applications always worked. It would help them test more easily
            using the magic of data and machine learning, and with integration to services
            like Power Automate. Our first job was to lay out a plan and hire
            the right team to bring this service to life.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            And we did. In the beginning, we called this new service <a href=
            https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/accelerate-application-validation-with-the-update-staging-lab/ba-p/977266
            >Update
            Staging Lab</a>. In year 1 of the service being built, we were a team
            of less than 10 people in Redmond, feverishly discussing what the
            product should be. What was the Total Addressable Market? What were
            the stages of building the service? What should the MVP be? Where
            was the funding coming from and how to pitch the service right?
            What was the business model? What were our operating principles? So many questions to pose and answer. These were very exciting
            times for me, personally, and for my team.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        But even more exciting times were coming. A year in, we were working
        with about 20 customers on the MVP. One of our operating principles was
        to work with customers from day 1. We wanted to build something that
        people wanted - not something we built in a vacuum and had to sell
        later. Another principle was to be experimental, not to let analysis
        paralyze us, but use data to be agile in getting to market. We wrote
        lots of code and were scrappy about getting it live and getting
        feedback.
    </p>

        We announced Private Preview at Ignite 2019, just a year after we came
        together as a team. In the meantime, we had traveled to Lagos, Nigeria
        to hire our first international team, one of Microsoft's first teams in
        our Africa Development Center. In just a few months after this - in
        2020 - spurred on by a pandemic, the whole world was forced to learn
        how to effectively work in remote settings. Our team started learning
        these lessons early.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p lang="EN-US">
        As soon as we onboarded our Lagos team, we learned that we needed to
        set up folks with autonomy, get used to more asynchronous communication
        channels, relentlessly drive for clarity in what we needed to
        accomplish together, limit meetings where everyone needed to be in a
        room (physically or otherwise) at the same time, be intentional about
        scheduling meetings at times that will work for folks in their time
        zone, and so on.

<div>
    <p>
        For these adjustments to our working style and culture, we got plenty
        in return. Our Lagos team brought in new energy, new ways of reasoning
        over problems. We hired bright, new talent. Our product
        documentation got better. Our service excellence improved, thanks to
        having folks in different parts of the globe paying attention to
        Production. We learned flexibility is table stakes for doing business.
        We trained ourselves to be more inclusive, no matter if you are in a
        room with us or thousands of miles away. As a team, we were now
        creative and productive 'round the clock'. Most importantly, we *loved*
        the multi-cultural aspect of our team, celebrating cultural events
        together, learning things from each other.

        In the summer of 2020, we announced our new name, Test Base for
        Microsoft 365, along with many new features. We welcomed engineers on
        yet another continent - this time in Shanghai - to work on Test Base.

        Now we were starting to build a truly global service with our global
        team, spread over three continents. Onboarding new members remotely,
        working toward a Public Preview, and being compassionate and supportive
        of each other during a pandemic kept us on our toes. We reminded each
        other to think with both our heart and our head, to make decisions
        nimbly, to respond to customer needs, and yet slow down enough to take
        care of ourselves.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        This July, we announced Public Preview and made the service accessible
        to anyone who wants to preview it. Since then, over 500 companies and
        organizations have taken advantage of the service, doubling down on
        their testing and quality. Some of these customers can now start
        testing their applications weeks before Windows Updates come out, mere
        days after a build becomes available in the Windows engineering lab.
        Something that has never been available before.
    </p>
</div>
<div>

        We are now entering a new chapter for Test Base. At Ignite this morning, we annouced General Availability for Test Base. Check it out 
        <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/test-base-blog/test-base-for-microsoft-365-has-reached-general-availability/ba-p/2893854">here</a>. 
        We are enabling more
        features and workflows for our commercial customers. Test Base now
        supports testing applications against Windows 11 builds. There is so
        much more in the offering that Rama goes into depth on, so be sure to read about it all in his blog.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        I am incredibly proud of it all, proud of what we have accomplished,
        and how we have weathered storms together. I am grateful for my team
        and all the leaders that have leaned in to make this happen. It's been
        about three years since Test Base was just an idea on a word document on our SharePoint, two years since we became a global team. As I look back, these
        have been eventful years that have taught me a lot.

        It indeed takes more than an isolated village to build a truly global, world-class service. 
        Our diversity is our strength. Having folks build Test Base from
        different parts of the world makes the service more suitable for a
        global market and a global audience. It makes it easier to tend to our
        customers' needs quickly. I am glad to see more companies adapt to a
        more remote and hybrid workplace, where our colleagues can be anywhere
        in the world. I truly think this makes us a better team. But we still
        have work to do. We need to continue to deepen our learning to support
        - not just allow - remote workers. We need to adapt our workplace
        culture and mindset to be more flexible, inclusive, and open. Test Base
        is a service built to support an important function - testing - to be
        done from anywhere. We need to use more services like it to change the
        way we work together - to work from anywhere in the world. That is how
        we can thrive in this new era.
