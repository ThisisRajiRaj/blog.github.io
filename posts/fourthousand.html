title: Four thousand weeks: a case for embracing what you can't control
date: February 09, 2022

<p>
    When my mother died one fine morning thirty-nine years ago, we didn't
    expect it. My father was just thirty-seven at the time. I am sure that at that moment he was
    devastated, shaken up. If he had considered his future stretching out in front
    of him, I am guessing he would have seen uncertainty. He might have
    imagined a bleak picture. He might have been worried about how he was going to
    raise two young children, all on his own from then on.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward almost four decades, and our family is just fine. Sure, we
    endured challenges and setbacks, just like many people and many families
    do around the globe. But we still love our dad, and we are all still mostly
    ok. My mother passing away, while heart-rending, didn't mean a
    catastrophe for us. We dealt with it as we always deal with any obstacle in
    front of us. Life unfolded along a dimension that I am sure my dad had
    never imagined before.
</p>
<p>
    But that's how future is - not fully in our control and often surprising
    us. Yet at moments of uncertainty, we get all worked up because we want
    future to be entirely in our control. We want future to materialize exactly
    as we envision it. We want it to not surprise us.

    Our efforts to influence the future aren't the problem. The problem-the
    source of all the anxiety-is the need that we feel, from our vantage point
    here in the present moment, to be able to know that those efforts will
    prove successful.

    But trying to control everything about the future is a fool's errand. We can have a strong desire for certain
    outcomes, for sure. We can craft a strong plan to help us achieve those outcomes. Our
    control over those outcomes, however, is limited. It is best
    for our mental health to internalize that fact fully. That is one of the
    core ideas behind the book <strong>"Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals" by Oliver Burkeman"
    </strong>.

    I read a lot of books - books that help me with my work, trashy novels that are just entertainment, and everything in between.
    Every once in a while, I read a book that offers me a different way to look
    at life. <i>Four Thousand Weeks</i> was one such book.

    Have you ever pondered what you want from your life? Many of us think that
    we want to be successful. Society often defines success on the surface: how
    productive you are, how wealthy, how big is your title, if your personal
    life looks like a perfect Regency dance, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    But where does that all lead to?
</p>
<p>
    We have a limited amount of time on earth, about four thousand weeks on
    average human lifespan. We have limited control over the eternal future of
    this universe or even the more constrained future of our lifetime. We have
    limited abilities at the many things we can possibly do with our time here.
    We can only do a limited number of things at any moment and, cumulatively,
    in our life. Given all that, the author Oliver Burkeman argues, our best
    course of action is to fully embrace our limits and still carry on with
    what we must do.

    Perhaps most radically of all, seeing and accepting our limited powers over
    our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you
    use in the first place. There is an alternative: the unfashionable but
    powerful notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an
    opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a
    matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.

    Embracing these limits, he proffers, is strangely liberating. When you are
    not overwhelmed about all the things that you could be doing at any moment,
    you are fully present for what you're doing and you enjoy it all the more.
    When you are not worried about how other people in an unknowable future
    will react, you are free to do your work authentically and bring forth
    value for the present. When you are not anxious about outcomes, about the uncertain future, you just do
    the work that needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
    We are always told to NOT accept our limits. Not accepting our limits is
    at the heart of Growth Mindset. I am a big fan of learning constantly,
    and Growth Mindset wonderfully appeals to me. I could become a runner only
    because I didn't limit myself when was in my twenties that I could not
    become an athlete after being inactive all those years. I could continue to
    write only because I believed I could continue to improve my writing.
</p>
<p>
    But Burkeman's limit-embracing view had a role to play in it too. I knew I
    would never become a world-class sprinter. That was not a goal I could
    manage along with the other pursuits in my life. I didn't have a genetic
    advantage in the sport. I was ok accepting these limits. I knew I would
    really well in some areas of my life, and in other areas, it was just ok to
    be average.
</p>
<p>
    This is not a view we often embrace consciously. And Four Thousand Weeks
    asks us do exactly that. We are lucky to be alive. We had little control
    over most of the things that made us - who our parents were, how they
    raised us etc. - and yet we are here, and most of us, most of the time, we
    are just fine. Lack of control does not mean a life you cannot manage.
    Burkeman drives this point in a dozen excellent chapters.

    Once you give up on the unattainable goal of eradicating all your problems,
    it becomes possible to develop an appreciation for the fact that life just
    is a process of engaging with problem after problem, giving each one the
    time it requires-that the presence of problems in your life, in other
    words, isn't an impediment to a meaningful existence but the very substance
    of one.

    Whether you are overwhelmed about the innumerable things you can't get to,
    or you feel you are not being productive enough, or pondering your life,
    legacy, and the future, or simply want to get acquainted with a different
    philosophy of life, I recommend this book to you. It might just change your
    life, or at least how at peace you are with it.
