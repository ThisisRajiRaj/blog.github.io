title: The very human capacity to support and empower each other
date: January 16, 2023

<p>
    When I was 23 years old, having left India and starting to build a
    life of my own, I was drunk on the importance of my own independence.
</p>
<p>
    Personal freedom was a value I cherished. I wanted to rely on myself, always. I 
    wanted other people to do the same. 
</p>
<p>I have realized over the rest of my 20+ years on earth how wrong I had been to have been such a fan of independence. 
    I have over the course of my life and work that other people indeed matter. Community matters.
    Building relationships, indeed, matters.
</p>
<p>
    Relationships, of course, have been essential in times of sickness, pain, and
    grief. When I grieved an aunt who died early, it was my family&#8217;s
    warmth that got me past it. When I burst into tears at the 17<sup>th</sup>
    mile of a training run for my marathon, it was my partner&#8217;s love and
    energy that kept me moving.
</p>
<p>
    But relationships are not just for times of need, but also for times of joy
    and plenty. They are needed for work as much as in personal life. Building
    strong rapport with your coworkers makes your work more pleasant and easier.
    People make life more interesting, more meaningful.
</p>
<p>
    Let me tell you why I am going on and on about this today.
</p>
<p>
    I published my debut book <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/daring">&#8220;Daring to be Different&#8221;</a> in Dec 2022.
    My act of publication was a natural extension of my mentoring and my
    blogging. I had previously shared my stories and perspectives with my
    mentees and blog readers. What I said and wrote resonated with people.
    Folks found my words useful in their own lives. So, I decided to publish
    more of them in a book. I didn&#8217;t plan or aim for it to become one of
    the top 20 bestsellers among Business Leadership training books in Amazon. In fact, I didn't think it would actually 
    be read by more than a small clique of people.

    But thanks to the community I had organically built over the years at
    Microsoft and online, there came an outpouring of support as soon as I
    announced it. A VP at my company, whom I admire and respect, bought it
    for himself and all his staff. He invited me to speak to his team and
    championed the topic and the book with everyone.
</p>
<p>
    A mentee not only read the book, but also shared it with all his
    acquaintances. He started thinking and scheming my next promotional
    activities for me.
</p>
<p>
    Someone who works with me, and is quite savvy with social media, offered to
    do social posts to spread the word.
</p>
<p>
    Some people wrote reviews. Some people tweeted. Some wrote me personal
    messages to tell me how much they appreciated the stories and the advice in
    the book. A dear, dear friend sat with me and made me think of 50 more
    ideas to work on related to it. She is now planning my very first book
    launch party for me.

        <blockquote>
            The human capacity to support and empower each other is staggering.
            
        </blockquote>

<p>
    I understand that people might buy my book because the content in it is timely and
    useful. Because I have credibility in the industry and people want to see
    what I have to say. But what I feel moved by is how many of the people have
    gone above and beyond simply buying the book and reading it.
</p>
<p>
    I feel blown away by the support and the love. I didn&#8217;t hire a launch
    team. I didn&#8217;t ask any of them to do it before they volunteered. The
    people that came to my side are all people that I have known and worked
    with over the years.
</p>
<p>
    The human capacity to support and empower each other is staggering. While
    many of these humans that surrounded me with so much love are Microsofties
    &#8211; for whom &#8220;empowering others to achieve more&#8221; is indeed
    a mission &#8211; I have seen this wonderful capacity in many others around me too.
</p>


<p>
    I may have gained some success in my career in the traditional ways of
    looking at success. I have shared my experience and perspectives
    on this in my book. But truly what I count as success is the fellowship I
    seem to have organically gathered around me. Taking the time to build that
    rapport, that connection, to impact someone else positively without really
    expecting anything in return, indeed comes back to you in ways you never
    anticipated.
</p>
<p>
    Freedom and independence are still values I cherish. But I also now cherish
    community and connecting with people as values of equal importance. They
    truly bring meaning to your life, and they bring you joy when you
    least expect it.
