    Sometimes you get good things in life because you are in the right place at
    the right time. Most times, though, you work to steer yourself
    proactively into that exact place at that exact time.

    I love low light photography. The quality of natural light at the right time of day, 
    when the sun is at a low enough angle to light my subjects softly, is just magical. The
    pictures in this post were taken last weekend in Cannon Beach, Oregon, at sunset. That
    evening, we got possibly the most spectacular sunset I had ever seen. The sky
    dazzled with blues and pinks and oranges. I ended up that night with some of the best
    pictures I have taken ever since I took up photography as a hobby.

    But there is more to these pictures than what you see. Here are a few
    things you DO NOT see:

           I had previously read books, followed other photographers, and watched videos to 
           learn the camera work needed for low light photography and good composition.

            I had researched the previous day online for the best spots for
            sunsets on the OR coast. I had picked the Haystack Rock as where
            I’d be that evening.

            We had driven to the beach earlier in the day to scope out the area
            for different photography angles.

            I had come back to the rock an hour before sunset, dressed in
            multiple layers and a beanie and gloves, so that I could assess the type
            of light and the position of tides.
        </p>
    </li>

        <p>
            I had foregone the other delightful options that evening to just
            sit on a blanket and read a book or take in the sunset in the arms
            of my partner.
        </p>

            I had walked around in cold December seaside weather, lugging my
            camera and my tripod for an hour and a half, shooting several pictures. Another 
            photographer I met had come even more prepared: he was wearing wellies.
        </p>
    </li>

            Dozens of these pictures ended up being dull. Only a couple did the
            grand show of light the justice it deserved.

    Serendipity made this picture, to some extent. The sunset that day was just
    astonishing and I couldn't have planned for it. But preparation, vision, passion, determination, an ability to
    put up with discomfort, prioritization, and a stomach for failure were all
    part of it too…just like they are part of many opportunities and successes
    we have in our lives. Often, we see just the things that are visible to us and get misled by how easy someone's success 
     might look. 
    It is important to peel back the layers to understand everything that truly went into it.

    For those interested in the technical details of the pictures: The picture of the Haystack rock swathed in golden light was taken at
    5:02pm at f14, ISO 100, and 1/320 seconds shutter speed. The photo of the
    stunningly blue and pink sunset with the tide moving back into the ocean
    was taken at 6:10pm at f22, ISO 50, and 3.2 seconds shutter speed.  The photos were processed using Adobe Lightroom on Windows 11.
