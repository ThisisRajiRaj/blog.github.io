title: Moving forward with brokenness

<p>Death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the inescapable destination of life. Every life that is born will die. Has to die. Every philosophical
    tradition contemplates death. The Buddhists say that the glass is already broken to prepare our minds for the
    inevitable &ndash; the glass actually breaking. The Hindus urge us to live with <em>non-attachment </em>to things
    and to people. The stoics ask us to remember death with every breath we draw. <em>Memento mori</em>, they say.
    Scientists assert that entropy &ndash; decay, disorder &ndash; always increases in a closed system. So, death must
    be accepted as a natural consequence of living. But yet&hellip; When a person that you love dies, your
    heart is shredded raw. You become unmoored, distraught.</p>
<p>My dear father &ndash; the person I loved first and loved deeply &ndash; died on November 20, 2023. It was a day that
    dawned like any other for me in Seattle. I had taken the week off to celebrate my 25<sup>th</sup> wedding
    anniversary with my partner. As I lay in bed, rubbing my eyes and mentally enumerating my tasks for the day, the
    phone rang. It was a phone call that many immigrants - that many living far away from their loved ones &ndash;
    dread. I&rsquo;ve feared it every time the phone rang very early in the morning or late at night. My brother was on
    the other side. &ldquo;Appa is no more,&rdquo; he croaked amid sobs. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was hearing. I
    asked him to repeat it a few times before I understood what had happened.</p>
<p>It was not that I didn&rsquo;t expect that my father would die one day. I even understood rationally that he, as a
    septuagenarian, will die sooner than later. He had been in and out of the hospital a couple of times in the previous
    two months. His quality of life had started declining. While he had spent a glorious half year with us in the United
    States &ndash; joking, sharing stories over dinner, seeing places, debating philosophy, and visibly appreciating
    good food &ndash; his health had taken a turn for the worse toward the end of his stay with us. It all came rather
    suddenly. One day it was minor discomfort in his stomach, and the next he was rushed to the clinic for a battery of
    tests.</p>

<p>After he returned to India, it was a sharp deterioration. He had to stop eating salt altogether. He started becoming
    frail. Still, my brother and I &ndash; and my father too, I believe &ndash; were full of hope that his health would
    return to normal. That he would get better and come and live with us in the US. He continued talking to us on
    WhatsApp, even though he was less frequent in initiating or responding to messages. On November 19<sup>th</sup>,
    less than a day before his death, I had sent him a picture of me speaking at a local Tamil community event to
    celebrate Diwali. Unusually for him &ndash; he usually goes agog over every speaking engagement of mine - there was
    no response. Shortly after, I had sent him a picture of my partner and me dressed to the nines for our
    25<sup>th</sup> anniversary dinner. He had responded to this one: &ldquo;Excellent look. Many happy returns of the
    day. My blessings.&rdquo; It was his last communication with us.</p>
<p>My father had passed away a few hours later surrounded by his sister and his brother &ndash; two people he had loved
    dearly. He had had his dinner and medicines, walked to the bedroom, called for his siblings, thrown up twice, and
    collapsed on the bed, literally in the hands of his brother and sister. From what my uncle and aunt say, there was
    no struggle, no pain. It was a peaceful &ndash; albeit unexpected &ndash; end to a wonderful, impactful, eventful
    life.</p>
<p>My father was born the first son of my strong-willed, strong-bodied grandmother and her husband in Kumbakonam, a
    traditional small town in southern India. When he was a boy, he was fond of cricket. He played the game with his
    friends in the dusty streets of his town. He attended a public school with other children from low-income
    households. His school was run-of-the-mill, and his teachers hardly spoke English. The medium of instruction was
    Tamil. Yet, he had a strong pull toward the language and wanted to become fluent in it. English opened doors to a
    better life. He strived to better himself constantly, learn new things, and go after bigger opportunities than what
    was expected for his lot.</p>
<p>He threw his name into the hat for every competition at his school. In oratorical contests, he did well with his
    resounding voice and his impeccable articulation. But he was so competitive, so excited about trying everything,
    that he even participated in singing contests. There he did poorly, his ability to hold a tune next to his ability
    to chop wood with a spoon.</p>
<p>He devoured classic English novels &ndash; the likes of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s travels and The mayor of Casterbridge.
    </em>He loved the works of Shakespeare and the poetry of William Wordsworth. He would quote Sir Francis Bacon late
    into his life: &ldquo;Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, writing an exact man,&rdquo; he would say.
    He lived by this quote too, reading many books, opening his mind through conversations with diverse people, and
    writing prolifically.</p>
<p>A thoroughly yellowed copy of <em>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</em> lies open in front of me now.
    It&rsquo;s a prized possession of my dad, one he guarded through many transitions of his life, many moves across
    cities and towns. This book, above anything else, speaks to the kind of man my father was. His constant striving.
    His belief that he could do anything he could put his mind, including mastering obtuse classics as a boy growing up
    in a place where English was as infrequent as a supermoon. He had an uncanny ability to apply himself to a task and
    relentlessly follow through on it. This belief &ndash; that he could do anything &ndash; fueled his last days too.
    He felt that he could conquer what was ailing him. That he would come out of it healthy and ready to resume his full
    life with us. Alas, this was a fight he could not win.</p>
<p>After my father passed away, messages poured in. People stopped by to express their love and respect for him. My dad
    always gave his time and attention to people. To him, generosity was important and, above all, generosity of time.
    If a young person came to him needing help, he went out of his way to guide and help them. Someone told mem how he
    had helped them become a Chartered Accountant, a profession that helped him grow his wealth and retire early.
    Another told me how he helped him secure him an education loan. Another, how he encouraged her to pursue
    engineering, making her believe in herself, bringing her books to help in the process. The autorickshaw driver that
    he patronized told me how my father had encouraged him to speak at his union meetings and volunteer for bigger
    responsibilities. &ldquo;You are going to be a great speaker, Ravi,&rdquo; he had told him, &ldquo;someday you will
    become a minister for this state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father always had encouraging words for everyone. He always found things to appreciate in others and spent energy
    to find the words to convey his admiration. He wrote poems and essays to celebrate the people around him. So many
    became better, more affluent, happier, more successful, in their lives thanks to what my dad could do for them.</p>

<p>I stare at a single black and white image of my father as a ten-year old boy, hiding bashfully behind his beautiful
    curly-haired mother, and surrounded by his relatives. He is skinny and his eyes are wide and curious. What was that little boy thinking, I wonder.</p>
<p>Did he know that he would have a beautiful life in which he touched so many other lives so positively? Did he know
    that he would traverse a path of tribulations, that he would ever be a fighter? Did he know that he would remain
    positive through everything and have a temperament to &ldquo;always do his duty and not worry about the
    results&rdquo;? Did he know that he would lose the love of his life when he was barely thirty-five? Did he know
    he&rsquo;d father two children who would become his center of gravity, for whom he would not bat an eye to sacrifice
    anything? Did know he would accomplish a lot and still strive to accomplish more till almost the last days of his
    life? Did he know that he would author many books of poetry and of essays? Did he know that the people he left
    behind would feel gutted, would cry a cascade of tears after he passed?</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s passing away was not as untimely as my mother&rsquo;s. And yet, his death has been the most
    unsettling thing in my life. The pain comes at me in waves. One moment I am laughing at someone&rsquo;s jokes, and
    the next I become stony, pulled into some memory, some little thing about my dad. I have felt anger &ndash; anger at
    myself, at the medical system, at the people around me. I have felt the blackness of deep sorrow. I have felt pangs
    of regret: should have seen him more often, should have taken care of him better, should have had him treated in the
    US, should have noticed the early symptoms of his decline. So many should have&rsquo;s, could have&rsquo;s. I have
    felt the guilt of having been a terrible teenager and not a great daughter overall.</p>
<p>It's senseless to imagine that my father would live forever, and yet I cannot bear his passing. I console myself and
    my brother by saying many things that I want to believe more viscerally. I keep saying that he lived a long,
    beautiful life. That he&rsquo;d want us to be strong and carry on just as well and just as happily as before. That
    life must go on. That we must move forward with our loss. That we carry him with us, in our memories, in the stories
    he shared, in the lessons he passed on, in our personality and character that he was instrumental in shaping. My
    father will always be with us.</p>
<p>I want to believe all of it. And maybe if I keep telling these things to myself, one day I will. I will one day
    overcome this grief that now sits heavy as a grindstone on my chest. But for now, I feel broken. I must strive to
    move forward with this brokenness just as my dad did all his life.</p>

<p>The pain is harshest when I am in his house. I keep going back to the image of his lifeless body lying on the floor,
    as I did my daughterly rites to wash him &ndash; giving him his final bath. I think back to how I was distressed
    that his head was unsupported on the floor and that I needed to get him a pillow, until I remembered that he could
    not feel discomfort any longer. I remember his stillness, the grains of rice and the honey that we poured on his
    face pooling together and attracting flies, as I hoped irrationally that he would get up and object to what was
    happening to him.</p>
<p>I was with his body until the very end. The Hindu tradition doesn&rsquo;t allow women to attend the cremation
    process. But I insisted that I go with him to the end and bid him farewell properly. I kept my eyes open, welling
    with tears, as they pulled a lever that pushed into the oven, as they turned on the chutes of fire that would engulf
    him and incinerate him. I wailed like I have never done in my life. My cousin and his wife held me, but I
    couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. After about an hour, they gave us a tray of his bones and ashes. What a life he had led,
    what a man he had been, what ambitions he had had, how much good he had done in this world. He was gone now, reduced
    to a tray of white, yellow, and purple bones &ndash; his bones taking up different hues presumably from his
    medications &ndash; and pungent ashes.</p>
<p>My brother, my partner, and I took his ashes in a clay pot to the Besant Nagar beach adjoining the Bay of Bengal. We
    waded deep into the waters, waited for a big wave, tossed the pot into the ocean, turned around and walked back. We
    held each other and cried one more time for a loss that cannot be recouped.</p>
<p>My dear father is now truly one with the world.</p>
