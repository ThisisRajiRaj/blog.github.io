    Have you ever felt your heart race like it would burst out of your
    body, your breath getting caught in your throat, your back becoming unexplainably 
    stiff, and an ever-present sense of fatigue and being annoyed?
</p>
<p>
    These are some physiological symptoms of stress. You see it everywhere these days: 
    among children, teenagers, overworked
    caretakers, and most definitely in our workplaces. 
    In our fast and connected world, stress is as common as hackneyed rom-coms.
    
</p>
<p>The Oxford dictionary defines
    stress as "a state of mental or emotional strain resulting from adverse or
    very demanding circumstances". Certain amount of
    it, you can argue, is beneficial. Circumstances that demand a lot out of you
    can help you grow - grow new skills, become more self-aware, and build
    relationships. But most stress we feel is not of this kind. It is of a more
    negative, destructive kind.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of us work in professions where the stakes are high or the
    expectations - from ourselves and from others - are astronomical. 
    In the last two years, these
    stressors have multiplied. With our work-life defined by incessant
    virtual meetings, our caretaking workloads increasing, and multiple crises
    raging around the world, more people than ever are edging closer to
    burnout.
</p>
<p>
    Professor Anthony Klotz coined the term
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">
        "The Great Resignation"
    </a>
    to refer to the massive turnover he predicted (and we are
    starting to see now) post-pandemic. Using data from hundreds of interviews,
    he found that one of the biggest reasons for this exodus is the unbearably
    high workloads that people are no longer willing to tolerate.
</p>
<p>
    I am not surprised. Many people I know and mentor struggle with such high
    workloads. I myself am not a stranger to this. Stress has been a constant
    companion of mine for years now. Just like one learns to gently navigate
    around their loved one's quirks, I have developed my ways around stress. I
    have created daily practices for myself to deal with my physiological and
    emotional responses to it. Here are three of them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>Deep breathing. </strong>
    When I feel overwhelmed, I stop what I am doing, place my feet on the floor
    and my hands on my lap, and take deep breaths. Inhaling for a count of
    four, exhaling for a count of six, and continuing for five minutes. I also
    have a timer on my phone that chimes once every hour reminding me to take a
    few deep breaths.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Being physically active most days of the week.</strong>
    The freedom to be outside and breathe in fresh air is such a gift. Just
    lifting your gaze to see the vastness of the sky, to pay attention of the
    crispness of a leaf in the fall, or the cool touch of breeze can take your
    mind off your immediate problems. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>Making something with my hands. </strong>
    Creating things is joyful. When I feel low or stressed, the quickest way for
    me to snap out of it is to make something: cut tomatoes and onions and make
    a curry, write something for myself, or go to my backyard and take a
    picture. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The last couple of years, though, have put my rituals and practices through
    the wringer. This became obvious the day I visited a Planned Parenthood
    clinic in my neighborhood.

                Sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're 
                hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life instead of the good life. 
                And I think, for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.

    I was there to renew my birth control prescription. I was waitng in a small
    room lit with harsh blue light and smelling of hand sanitizer. As the nurse
    walked in with the blood pressure machine, I half suspected my numbers
    to be higher than usual: I had just gotten off a tense Teams call before
    driving over. But I was not expecting the numbers to be so high that
    the doctor refused to renew my prescription. I was half dismayed and half
    shaken by this news. My mother had died when she was just thirty-two from
    a mysterious cardiac illness. Even though my blood pressure numbers were
    nowhere near dangerous, it was indeed a wake-up call.
</p>
<p>
    The next wake-up call was even more strident. Arianna Huffington in her
    excellent book Thrive talks about the ease with which big crises can sweep
    away all the trivial ones that, moments before, had seemed enormous.
    Without getting into details for the sake of privacy, this summer, we had a
    huge health crisis for someone I love dearly. We took tests and more
    tests. We consulted with doctors. Health care is not one-click buying for
    sure, and there was to be no instant gratification. We had to wait. The
    moments I spent waiting were confusing and agonizing. Hopelessness
    and anxiety danced at my threshold like phantoms. I had never been so
    scared in my life.
</p>
<p>
    I had also never known as much relief as I did when we finally got good
    news, and we felt like we might be out of the woods.
</p>
<p>
    This crisis had not been kind to my physiological state. Alongside pandemic-related
    news from home and adjusting to 100% remote work, it had 
    created a perfect storm. I knew I had to double down on taking care of my
    mental health. I remembered how my strong, kind, and resilient father had
    always weathered such storms by deepening his faith. Without such strong
    belief, I had to find other ways to cope with my anxieties. I
signed up for classes about well-being online.<a href="http://rajiraj.com/blog/anxiety">I read books</a>. I took a 
<a href="http://rajiraj.com/blog/iceland">two-week break to disconnect</a>
    from everything, slow down, and simplify my life. I meditated more. I
    took advantage of a benefit offered to all Microsoft employees and enrolled
for <a href="https://www.meruhealth.com/">a 12-week mental health program</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I started feeling calmer. My blood pressure began to respond. I felt
    re-energized and centered despite the uncomfortable circumstances still
    around me. You can never get rid of everything that stresses you. If you
    aspire to have full life, if you dream big, if you love someone, you will
    undoubtedly find yourself in situations that daunt you. You will
    feel uncomfortable, and that could cause stress. 
</p>
<p> Quantum mechanics says
    that uncertainty is a fundamental property of our universe - you can
    never be sure of everything. Your life will take you on its turns and
    detours. You will endure many crises. The best you can do to be prepared
    for all of it is to get some tools in your toolkit to take care of your
    mental health. Just as I descale my coffee machine regularly and floss my teeth every day, I 
    need to pay attention to my mind. Whether it is talking to a professional or reading Marcus
    Aurelius or lighting candles in your room or calling up a friend to chat,
    find what works for you. Do it routiney, and do it starting today.
