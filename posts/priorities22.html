title: Two questions for the new year
date: December 31, 2021
---
<p>
    At the beginning of 2020, I wrote a list of goals for the year. Number one
    on the list was to travel more. We all know how that turned out.
</p>
<p>If 2020 and 2021 have taught us
    anything, it is that several things in this universe are beyond our
    control. This notion - the recognition and acceptance  of things
    beyond our control - is, in fact, one of the cornerstones of mental health.
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of things we cannot control doesn't mean resignation. It means
    resilience and a curiosity for what it is come. I am not sure what 2022 is
    going to bring. I am optimistic that, with the power of science and
    technology, we will overcome the challenges in front of us. But I am not sure exactly when
    we will be able to travel without restrictions, when we will be able to see
    our family, friends, and co-workers again regularly. 
</p>
<p>This uncertainty, though, is 
    ok. It is by being comfortable with uncertainty that we can build upon the possibilities we see and create. But uncertainty calls 
    for simplicity: being minimal in your assumptions and expectations. So, as I do my annual
    review and priorities-setting exercise today, I am keeping it simple. I
    am reflecting on the year past and writing my answers to just these two questions:
</p>

<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li>
        What and who brought me energy last year?
    </li>
    <li>
        What and who drained my energy last year?
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<br/>

<p>
    What energized me in 2021? Getting back into photography did. I was able to
    photograph some <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/iceland">spellbinding volcanic landscapes in Iceland</a> and <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/break">gorgeous skies
    in the deserts of Southern California</a>. I learned <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/spectral">some new skills</a>, which was
    another source of energy. Some of my family and friends inspired and kept me going
    during tough times. I volunteered for some important causes like <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/monica">empowering trafficking survivors 
    to become entrepreneurs</a>, and I mentored aspiring leaders in tech. Reading, writing, meditating, and creating
    ideas and new opportunities for my team also go on this list of things that energized me. 
    
</p>
<p>
    On the other side, worrying about the future was my #1 drainer of energy.
    Which is why I am extremely grateful for the resources that my company provides
    in taking care of mental health. A lot of our teams and family members have struggled with
    stress, anxiety, or depression, especially in the last couple of
    years. I am no exception. The last year brought its share of joys (my team shipped a great Windows 11 and 
    <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/global">Test Base GA</a>, 
    my nephew graduated and found a job), 
    but also a number of 
    <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/mentalhealth">stressors at work and home</a>. 
    Mindfulness, meditation, taking planned breaks during my days and the year all helped. 
    Another source of fatigue was the endless meetings that peppered my days. I intend to try 
    some of the ideas in <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/12/remote-work-should-be-mostly-asynchronous?">this article</a> to 
    improve how we do distributed work in the new year. Being part of the Windows team at Microsoft means that there are 
    several new exciting ways in which my team can contribute to the re-envisiong of work. 
</p>
<p>
    The point of writing the answers to these two questions is first to reflect on what 
    is past. As John Dewey, a 19th century philosopher, put it, we do not learn from experience, 
    we learn from reflecting on it. This reflection can help us understand
    what we want to do more of, what we want to do less of, and what we want
    to stop or keep doing in the new year. In addition to continuing to prioritize my
    mental health, my plan is to keep reading, writing, and investing time into
    photography. I plan to spend more time with the people that energized me
    and less time with the ones that exhausted me. 
</p>
<p>
    Now it is your turn to reflect. What activities and people gave you energy and you want to have more of
    in 2022? What activities and people exhausted you and want to have less of? I hope you find the answers to
     these insightful. Happy New Year!
