    I have disappointed my family in many things. But the biggest
    disappointment has been the fact that I have chosen not to have children.
    The person I have possibly disappointed the most in that regard is my
    beloved dad.
</p>
<p>
    Many of you who follow my blog know that I love my dad to bits. He made
    many sacrifices for us. He raised us - me and my brother - as a single dad,
    against many odds. He worked day and night to give us the best education he
    could afford. He taught me many life lessons that I cherish to this day -
    how to not be proudful, how to learn constantly and strive to become
    better, how to go after things with determination, how to build
    relationships, and so much more.
</p>
<p>
    My father's happiness means a lot to me. And I know that he sorely wanted
    me to have kids. He worried that, without kids to anchor us, we would
    become listless. To him, being happy involved having a
    purpose in life, and that purpose could only be served by having children.
</p>
<p>
    But that was <em>his</em> template in life, not mine.
</p>
<p>
    Everyone in the free world should be able to choose how they want to lead their life. 
    Life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness are enshrined in
    many cultures and codified into the constitution in some. For example:
</p>
<p>
    Some may choose to eat meat. Some may not.
</p>
<p>
    Some may choose to become teachers. Others may choose to become engineers.
</p>
<p>
    Some may choose to drive a red car. Others may choose to drive a blue car. Some
    others may choose to be without a car.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, some may choose to have kids and others may not.
</p>
<p>
    This choice - to not have kids -  more than anything else has defined what I want to do with my life.
    Purposeful life is not just about raising good children and having a
    thriving family. It is about living a life that brings you joy. That joy
    comes to me from many things - from traveling, from hiking in the woods,
    from listening to my heartbeat, from being still, from learning new skills,
    from reading, and from working with non-profits to do some little good in
    the world.
</p>
<p>
    Children bring a lot of joy to many people. I have adored my nephews
    myself, especially when they were tiny tots that prattled and played and cooed. 
    I have admired the process by which their intellect grew, year
    after year. I have been been impressed every year by something new they had learned or 
    could do. I have enjoyed seeing them grow into caring, loving, and
    responsible young men. I still treasure my time with them. But I have chosen to 
    not have kids of my own. It simply didn't appeal to me, even after many years of reflecting and discussing 
    with my partner. 
    This choice to not have kids, and instead to derive meaning from other avenues
    and people and interests, is just as valid and worthy and moral as the choice to have had kids.
</p>

    I know many countries in the world where economic power and the ability to
    have a career are taken away from women because they cannot control and
    choose what happens to their bodies. Many women brcome unintentionally saddled with too many 
    children to feed and clothe and take care of. They are helpless and powerless against 'fate'. 
    Their own interests and thriving take a backseat. 
    Coming to North America, I have felt a
    sense of freedom like I never had before. When that freedom is chipped
    away, one right at a time, I worry for the future generations of women.

    Around the globe, women were once treated like
    infants. They couldn't own property, couldn't choose their partners,
    couldn't dream to pursue anything other a handful of professions, couldn't
    have a say in the laws being made for their country. We have come so far in
    the fight for equality. Today women are CEOs and politicians and inventors and philanthropists.

    It is inspiring to see three women among the
    nine justices in the US Supreme Court today. But when the 
    same Supreme Court take away a crucial right from many young women, it is far from inspiring. It is disappointing. 
    It is heartbreaking. 
    By taking away the right to choose when to have children and how many to
    have - including none at all - we regress to the belief that women cannot be 
    trusted to make decisions about their own lives and their own bodies. We make many women powerless to lead a 
    life of their choosing. We take away economic power and the potential for it from a section of the population. 
    We once again start to infantalize women.
    And when we start here, where will we end?
