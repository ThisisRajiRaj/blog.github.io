title: Best laid plans at Mount Rainier National Park

    The best laid plans of mice and men, and suchâ€¦there are situations in life when
    you plan and plan, and when the time nears, you realize things are not what
    you thought they would be. In fact, most situations in life are like that.
    Some recent examples from my own personal and professional life:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    I had planned for a series of important meetings with my manager only to
    have my manager announce that he was retiring.
</li>
<li>
    I had planned to travel to see my family in India in 2020 only to have a
    global pandemic stop me from visiting them for more than two years.
</li>
<li>
    I had planned out a detailed workout program that ramped up every week in
    preparation for a long backpacking trip later this year. I got sick and
    couldn't work out for many day in a row and the program had to be
    rethought.
</li>

    In the beginning of this year, I had booked a trip to Mount Rainier
    National park, assuming that mid-July would be a good time to travel and
    hike. Sadly, this year turned out to be unduly rainy and snowy. The only road
    through the park remained closed. A lot of the trails in the park were
    still covered in snow, and we were disappointed that we couldn't hike in some
    of the most spellbinding areas.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The future is always unknown and amorphous. While I am not a person that could ever stop
    planning or do most things without some preparation, I also am a big fan of
    quickly adapting to things as they come. Ducking and diving and veering to adjust. In Mount
    Rainier National Park this month, we were disappointed as we arrived to
    find roads closed and many trails snowed out. But we decided to make the best
    of our time there and do some of the lower elevation trails and trudge on snow for as
    long as we could along the higher elevation ones.

    We walked along the snowy and high Deadhorse Creek Trail to Glacier Vista
    Point, and back down along the Skyline trail. This was by far the most
    amount of snow walking I had done in my life. I huffed and puffed my way
    up. I found myself slipping occasionally on my way down. I learned how to
    dig in with my heels first to create some traction along the path. It was
    thrilling and hairy at once, but a refreshing trek.

    We bundled up for an evening outside as we ventured out to stargaze. The
    cloudless and star-speckled sky was a treat to behold. We drove to
    Reflection Lake where the mountain cast a still image on the water and the
    sky was free of pollution from ambient light. I took a number of pictures
    of the inky starlit sky. We watched the light from a climber's headlamp
    move briskly down a cliff on Mount Rainier. We listened as the stillness in
    the area was disturbed by the occasional human voices and the few cars on
    the road.

    The next day we walked to Comet Falls along a rocky and rootsy trail. The
    trail was a steep climb all the way to a creek where the bridge had been
    washed out. We had to hopscotch along rocks and balance on fallen logs to
    cross the creek on our way to the falls. In the afternoon, we walked along
    another trail - a peaceful, shaded one - to Rampart Ridge. When you do this
    hike along the Rampart Ridge, you keep walking along a forest, then you
    round a bend, and voila - you are greeted by a most spectacular view of
    Mount Rainier. You then keep walking along another beautifully wooded path
    called the Wonderland trail. This trail goes on for over 90 miles around
    the park and we walked various sections of this that weekend.

    On the last day, we walked to yet another series of waterfalls - Carter
    falls, Madcap falls, and Narada falls. Mount Rainier National park is full
    of babbling waterfalls and thick forests. Our walk that day was over 11
    miles with flat sections and some steep uphill. We ended the hike and our
    trip with sore legs, sweaty feet, and tired shoulders - but with full and
    delighted hearts.

    It was great to spend three days in the Mount Rainier National park,
    wandering in nature, and trying to live a more simple life. The weekend
    didn't go exactly as planned, but then most things in life don't. I was
    happy at our ability to be nimble and adapt and make it a positive
    experience. If you go on your own adventure in the woods, plan, but be open
    to changing your plans. Openness to change helps you be not just successful
    in life but happy too.
