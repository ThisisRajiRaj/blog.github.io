                Sometimes I come across an image of a room where the 
                walls are lined with bookcases full of heavy, beautifully bound
                books. I did not grow up in a home like that. In my father's
                home, we had about a dozen books - musty, dog eared classics -
                stowed away in a wooden crate on our attic. Those were all the
                books we possessed.
            </p>
            <p>
                These books, though, were full of knowledge and murmurs of a
                bygone time. They were written by remarkable writers like
                Shakespeare, Dickens, and Hardy. They were peopled with humans
                dressed in unrelatable outfits: Top hats and cravats and
                bonnets. Ruffs and collars and breeches. These books smelled of
                dust and damp. When you opened one of
                them and flipped through their yellowed crinkly pages,
                a silver worm or two would crawl out. They were my father's dear possessions, the
                books he hoped would help him learn big English words and win
                the respect of his colleagues.

                As a child, I remember scurrying down the labyrinthine narrow
                alleys of Royapettah with my aunt as she made her way to a
                local lending library. This library loaned books in Tamil -
                they had very few, if any, English language books. I could
                borrow one book at a time and keep it for a week. I remember
                occasionally indulging in a trashy fantasy novel where the hero
                had to perform extraordinary feats of bravery: go on adventures
                fording gushing rivers, scale craggy mountains, slay monsters
                to save a beloved's life. But it was just that occasional,
                one-off reading. I never thought of myself as a reader then.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a girl I was preoccupied with learning my place in my
                household, bending myself around the people I lived with, and
                finding ways to bend them around my needs and wants. Reading
                was a luxury I couldn't afford - in more ways than one.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I got married and moved to Canada, though, the tenor and
                timbre of my life changed. Suddenly, I had stability. I had a
                place in the world where I could learn how to be an adult. I
                could read, run, jump, dress as a scarecrow if it pleased me -
                I could do anything I wanted without worrying about
                inconveniencing a relative and getting an earful from a
                querulous grandmother. It helped that the man I had married had
                a sweet temperament and principles that stood for justice and
                equality.

                The local library in Richmond, Canada, where we lived, felt
                like a temple to me. A temple that was so quiet that a rustle
                of clothes, a whisper from a patron, the click of boots sounded
                too loud. The space - in retrospect- was actually small. But at
                that time, having been used to my hometown libraries that were
                narrower than airplane lavatories, I clocked them as cavernous.
                Rows and rows of chestnut shelves filled with books full of
                wisdom, information, entertainment. I could borrow 25 books at
                once and keep them for a month!!! It almost felt like an
                embarrassment of riches. If someone had given me a chest full
                of gold coins to lie in, I wouldn't have felt richer or
                happier.

                I soon started reading everything I could get my hands on. We
                moved to Vancouver as I started college in UBC. Our home was in
                the basement of a two storied Victorian house. There were two
                small rectangular panes of glass that let in sunlight into our
                single bedroom. Most of the time, in cloudy Vancouver, the
                sunshine was weak and pale. I had a light brown IKEA desk in
                one corner of our bedroom. This was where I stacked all my
                library books and wrote a few things on my margined and lined
                notebooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I devoured all the "all time must read" classics. Maybe it was
                the early subconscious influence of my dad or maybe it was what
                I thought one should do to become well read. Or maybe, simply -
                and this was very likely - I truly enjoyed learning about
                worlds and times that are not our own. Regency dances, long
                muslin dresses, and dainty teacups in staid English drawing
                rooms amused me. They still amuse me. So I read Shakespeare and
                Dickens and Hardy. I relished the arcane and complex words in
                them. I puzzled over the state of womanhood in Jane Austen and
                George Eliot. I leaned about poverty, class, workers movements
                and women's empowerment from Elizabeth Gaskell. I borrowed
                books on slavery and civil rights in America. I tried to enjoy
                Hemingway and Fitzgerald, but I never got the high praise about
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I read non fiction books on rationality and scientific
                thinking. I read memoirs and fiction set in Iran and
                Afghanistan. I read books about reading books and about writing
                books.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am still ravenous for all kinds of books. Now I have a
                digital device that can hold 10s of 1000s of books at once, and
                I often greedily borrow too many books into it from my local
                library. I am known to forget my purse or my Microsoft badge to
                get me into my office, but I rarely forget my reading device.
                It goes with me in my large handbag wherever I go: whether it
                is to the dentist's office or the supermarket or a pub.

                My local library has been my refuge for many years now, my
                favorite place in the world to be. Before the pandemic, I used
                to drive to the library on sunny Saturday afternoons to just
                sit in the stillness and the quiet and read. Our local branch
                has tall French windows where sunshine streams in plentifully.
                The reading room has several deep armchairs upholstered in
                coarse patterned polyester. The library attracts all kinds of
                people: gaggles of kids that laugh and talk entirely too loudly
                for such quiet spaces, young women taking a break in the middle
                of their day by thumbing through magazines, homeless people
                sheltering indoors for a bit, aged folks that are hungry to
                interact with other humansâ€¦
            </p>
            <p>
                The pandemic broke my habit of visiting the library a few times
                a week. In fact, I had not set foot in one until last month
                when I decided to wander in one day. The library has changed
                for sure. Nothing remains unchanged by time. Just like you
                never notice the changes in a person you live with but you
                quickly observe all the ways someone has changed after a few
                years apart, I could sense all the ways the place felt
                unfamiliar. It smelled and looked and sounded like a foreign
                country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, my love for the library remains unchanged. Books have
                been my favorite companion for years now. The library is my
                favorite place to spend time in. This public space has meant so
                much in my life. It has afforded me an immeasurable level of
                access to resources to learn from, to become better as a human,
                and be entertained. I am forever grateful.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when I saw the other day that my local library has decided
                to purchase a few copies of my book - and there are three times
                as many holds on the book as there are copies available - I was
                thrilled. I am even more thrilled that I have the privilege to
                speak at a location of the library - this place that I love
                beyond imagination.
