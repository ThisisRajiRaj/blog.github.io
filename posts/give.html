title: How would you like to be remembered?

    A realization came to me as I sat in my mother-in-law's house on a stuffy
    Indian afternoon, listening to people eulogize my father-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    He had passed away a few days before. My father-in-law came from humble
    beginnings. He couldn't complete his college because he had to start
    working to support his family. He took up a job as a welder making coaches
    for Indian Railways. Yet, with that small income, he found a way to raise
    two sons that ended up making great careers for themselves. He was very
    proud of his son's lives - our lives. But he was no slouch himself. He,
    alongside his wife, had managed to raise his family out of poverty.
</p>
<p>
    But few of the folks that shared their memories of my father-in-law talked
    about his successes. None of them talked about his wealth or his work. They
    talked about his kindness. About how he had helped the flower seller who
    squatted outside his house when the flower seller most needed money. About
    how he had helped someone send his kids to college. About how he had helped
    someone else with their medical bills. About his compassion and his big
    heart.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        I realized at that moment that what people remember most when you leave
        this world is not how much you worked or how 
much you earned, but how you
        touched the lives of others. Your legacy will likely not be your job
        titles.

    This is why the month of October is very special to me. As folks in high
    tech, we have the kind of access of resources that few in the world have
    today. At the same time, there are so many causes crying out for our
    attention. I love that, at Microsoft, we put so much energy and passion to
    give back to the world during the Give Campaign month.
</p>
<p>
    This year, for the Give Campaign, I am donating the following through
    Microsoft Auction:

    If you are an employee of Microsoft based in the US and would like to contribute through MSAuction this year, 
    place your bid using the link above. With holidays around the corner, this could
    be perfect gift for yourself or someone you love. Because these are high
    quality images, you could print one of them at 20x30 for a colorful wall
    d√©cor! The proceeds from the auction benefit non-profits associated with making tech 
    accessible to everyone, to upskilling, and to equality in education.

    Churchill had his flaws but he was right when he said, "We make a living by
    what we get, but we make a life by what we give." I hope you take some time
    to give back this month.
