title: A glorious break
date: December 15, 2021

<p>
    Every athletic training program I have followed has had a formula. A few days
    of intense working out a week, interspersed with a few days of easy
    activity, and always including a day or two of recovery. Rest and recovery
    are essential components of growth. Only when you rest, your muscles get a
    chance to repair and rebuild. Coaches and athletes know that your body
    needs rest to function well.
</p>
<p>
    Your mind is no exception. If your work - like mine and many others' these
    days - involves intense mental work, you should intentionally be including rest
    periods. These rest periods should be true rest periods, periods where you step away
    from everything that agitates or overstimulates your mind.
</p>
<p>
    Recently, I took a weeklong break from work that was intended to be such a period of
    rest. It was not just a week without work. It was a week without TV, social
    media, and even the usual places that are part of my routine. My husband
    and I spent evenings watching the sun set, early mornings listening to 
    birds sing, and afternoons hiking dusty desert trails. I
    participated in a meditation retreat and generally lazed around as much as
    I could. I enjoyed every part of our trip: spending time in Joshua Tree
    National Park, a small town in Southern California called Julian, and San
    Diego, a city I loved as much for its wonderful food as for its
    spectacular beaches.
</p>
<p>
    Julian is a Dark Sky Town and was our first stop on the trip. The big sky
    above Julian dazzled with a trillion stars, like a massive chandelier above
    our heads.

    Every night, after dinner, we religiously made our way to
    locations as far from civilization as possible. I set up my tripod and
    shifted my gaze above. Every time as new stars blinked alive on the sky, I
    took a deep breath in, and felt connected to something much bigger than
    myself. Brilliantly starlit skies have a way of taking your mind off your
    own concerns. They make you feel in touch with the enormity of the
    universe. Every time I saw the splendid skies of Julian, I was moved to
    tears, feeling grateful and fortunate that I have this life to see such
    wondrous things.
</p>
<p>
    Our second stop on the trip was Joshua Tree National Park. The park spans
    two desert systems - the Mojave and the Coloradan - and sports the namesake
    tree that is found only in that part of the world. The tree creates a
    gnarly, beautiful silhouette against the sky, and is home to many equally
    tough wildlife like lizards, quails, and wrens. We got more starlit nights
    here, and stunning sunsets and sunrises.

    Back in the city of San Diego, we were able to enjoy the glamours of the
    city: great food, brisk night life, and a cozy, orderly Japanese garden.
    San Diego has some of the pinkest sunsets I have ever seen. From the island
    of Coronado, the skyline of San Diego gets lit progressively in golden
    light, orange, pink, and inky blue of deep twilight. Such a show never gets
    boring no matter how many times you photograph or see it. Standing on the
    shore of the bay, skyscrapers reflecting on the water, dogs frolicking on
    the wet sands, a gentle breeze brushing your skin, your mind feels far away
    from any concerns that unsettled it just a week ago.
</p>
<p>
    By the time we were back at the airport, ready to board our plane out of
    San Diego, I felt reenergized and at peace.

    When was the last time you gave yourself such a gift of disconnection? It
    may not be a trip to a new city. Perhaps it's a day or a weekend of detox.
    You could visit a neighborhood you have never visited before. You could pay
    close attention to flowers and their colors. You could walk along a beach
    and notice the shapes and texture of different pebbles. You could look at
    the sky and watch clouds pass, and the colors shift as the day progresses.
    You could wake up at dawn and gaze at the reflections on the dew drops
    clinging to blades of grass. There is so much nature everywhere for anyone
    who pays attention. And paying attention to nature is a great way to unplug
    yourself from your daily concerns and feel connected to the glorious
    universality of life.
