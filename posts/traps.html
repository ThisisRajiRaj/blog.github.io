title: Nine Thinking Traps
date: January 2, 2022

<p>
    It was the summer of 2018. I had been asked to present some demos at a Keynote at Microsoft Inspire.
    Microsoft Inspire is a massive conference that welcomes over 10,000
    attendees every year, most of them IT Professionals, Software Vendors, and
    System Integrators for big enterprises.
</p>
<p>
    Over 10,000 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and close to a million
    viewers online. I had never spoken in front of such an enormous audience
    before. So far, my presentations had been in small rooms of a dozen people
    or in medium-sized All-Hands of around 100 of my own team. I had no clue
    how to scale up to this size of an audience.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, Microsoft came to my rescue. Once I said yes (with trepidation
    dancing in the back of my head), the team responsible for the keynote put
    me through some rigorous training. I got a ton of feedback and made a
    number of changes to my script. Finally, the big day arrived.
</p>
<p>
    My demo was supposed to last 30 minutes, cycling through many of the
    offerings in the Microsoft 365 portfolio. I got on stage, energy in my
    stomach jumping around like overactive molecules in boiling water. The greenroom
    felt cold. The stage, colder. The blue light shining down on me on felt blinding.
     I couldn't see the audience, not even my friends who
    were eagerly applauding from the front row. I began my demo.
</p>
<p>
    As I was in the middle of it, walking through a script that I had rehearsed
    many times before, I knew something was off. The buttons I was expecting on
    the screen were not there! I had no clue where these buttons had gone off to,
    and I needed to click on them to flow through my demo. (I learned later
    that the team had deployed a new version of the code to production.) I
    stumbled over my words and started to sweat. I could sense over 20,000
    eyeballs on me. I felt I was hurtling toward disaster. This was not the
    smooth landing I had hoped for. I handwaved through the next steps and
    ended my demo.
</p>
<p>
    I got offstage and walked to the backroom. As I was walking, a series of
    thoughts circled through my head: everyone in my leadership likely saw what
    a bad job I did and was thinking poorly of me; why did I even sign up to
    this, I was never going to be a great presenter; my entire demo was such a
    fiasco. And on and on.
</p>
<p>
    When I saw my demo team in the backstage, my shoulders drooped. I told them
    I was sorry for failing them. What I was met with in return were stares of
    puzzlement. Turned out, no one had really realized that anything was off,
    except me. They had all felt that the demo had gone great. As I opened up
    Outlook on my phone, I saw many notes of congratulations from my colleagues
    who all said they had loved seeing me on stage and the storytelling. So,
    why was I so off in my perception of the presentation compared to almost
    everyone else?
</p>
<p>
    That's because I had just fallen prey to what psychologists call "Thinking
    Traps". As part of a recent stress management program I undertook, I
    learned about nine of them.
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Fortune telling</strong>: This is when you predict the future,
    with a strong negative bias. E.g.: "I'll never be a good presenter".
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Black and white thinking</strong>: This is also called "all or
    nothing thinking" - something is either all good or all bad. E.g.: "I made
    two mistakes in that presentation. It was a disaster".
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Mind reading</strong>: Humans - like few other organisms - can
    try and guess the contents of minds that are not their own. But often we
    guess wrong. E.g.: "They think I am not a good presenter".
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Over-generalization</strong>: We tend to take one incident and
    make something about that all-pervasive or permanent about our lives. E.g.:
    "I always screw up in presentations"
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Labeling</strong>: This is the tendency to attribute overarching
    character traits based on specific incidents or behaviors. E.g.: "I made
    two mistakes in one presentation. I am such a bad presenter".
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Overestimating danger</strong>: When we take molehill, build it
    up into a mountain, and worry for our security, we are falling into this
    trap. E.g.: "I did a poor job in my talk. I am going to lose my reputation
    and get fired".
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Negative filtering</strong>: Many of us have a predilection for
    the negative. We zone in on critical feedback and obsess over it 10 times
    more than praise. We disregard the positives about a situation and fret
    about the negatives. E.g.: "Everyone was bored. I saw three people in the
    audience looking at their phones".
</p>
<p>
    8. <strong>Catastrophizing</strong>: Sometimes, when we make small errors,
    our minds can mislead us to imagine the worst case. E.g.: "Now I went and
    did it. One day I am going to be an utter failure living under a bridge".
</p>
<p>
    9. <strong>Should and Must statements</strong>: Our lives overflow with
    "should's" and "must's". We rarely question these and try to satisfy them,
    almost on autopilot. E.g.: "I should always be on and always do a perfect
    job"
</p>
<p>
    On that sweltering summer day in Las Vegas, I was guilty of at least #2,
    #3, #4, #6, #7, and #9 on that list.

    Knowing about these traps helps us to reason over our own automatic thinking patterns.
    This means that we can now stop ourselves when we get sucked into
    behaviors that are no good for our mental wellbeing. Stopping and
    wondering if we are falling into any of these traps short-circuits the
    default-mode network that drags us into behaviors that we are hardly
    conscious of. When Descartes said in the 16<sup>th</sup> century "I think,
    therefore I am", he didn't have the background that neuroscientists and
    psychologists have today. We now know from science our brains construct our
    reality for us. It is therefore super useful to be aware of traps in
    our thinking so there is a chance of perceiving the world closer to
    reality.
