title: My 2021 Book Recommendations
date: December 14, 2021

<p>
    As a boy, my husband was a voracious reader, feverishly consuming comics
    and tales of detectives: Agatha Christies, Tarzan of the Jungle, The Jungle Book,
    Amar Chitra Kathas, Hardy Boys, you name it. I, on the other hand, hardly
    touched a book that was not a textbook.
</p>
<p>
    There were many reasons for it. Firstly, after my mother passed away, my
    life had become like a sea at storm. I moved every two years, staying with
    new relatives and making new friends. Second, my father wanted me to be
    academically successful. He encouraged me in learning math and grammar and
    science, but he was not a fan of casual reading. Lastly, I grew up in towns
    where I couldn't access many books. We didn't have a
    public (or even a private) library in Kumbakonam and Avinashi, two of the
    dusty towns I spent much of my childhood in.
</p>
<p>
    So, when I immigrated to Canada and found a public library with its rows of
    books, I was thrilled. I couldn't believe I could borrow twenty-five books
    at once, free of charge, and keep them for a month at home! I soon became a
    glutton for books. At first, my reading was purely informative - lots and
    lots of nonfiction. Material to prepare me for GRE exams, programming
    books, and books to deepen my critical thinking. Then I slowly started
    warming up to fiction and books that entertained me.
</p>
<p>
    But even today, my love for nonfiction endures. This year, I have read 34
    books so far, 25 out of which are nonfiction.

<p>
    Of all that nonfiction I read this year, one that stands out is Carl
    Honoré's "In Praise of Slowing Down". It is a book about why you should,
    and how you can slow down, in your life. From slow food to slow medicine to
    slowing down to do better work, it makes a great case for a gentler pace.
</p>
<p>
    This gospel on slowing down speaks to my heart. I have an innate desire for
    speed in everything I do. I take after my grandma for that. My grandmother
    was like a whirling dervish in her kitchen. She
    would often process five things in parallel, flitting like a hummingbird
    from one task to the next. She had three dishes cooking on the stove at
    once, a sink full of stainless-steel dishes soaped up, and laundry she was
    in the middle of hanging up on the clothesline. The
    house rang with the clatter of dropped plates and spoons when she worked.
</p>
<p>
    Like grandma, I love speed. I abhor being late to appointments. I grow
    impatient quickly. My first thought when I wake up is often my list of
    to-dos for the day. I multitask till cows come home from the high
    mountains. Which is why I sorely needed this reminder on the virtues of
    slowness. Slowing down can often help us do things faster and better.
    More importantly, slowing down can help us take care of ourselves better.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Like a bee in a flower bed, the human brain naturally flits from one
    thought to the next. In the high-speed workplace, where data and headlines
    come thick and fast, we are all under pressure to think quickly. Reaction,
    rather than reflection, is the order of the day. To make the most of our
    time, and to avoid boredom, we fill up every spare moment with mental
    stimulation…Keeping the mind active makes poor use of our most precious
    resource. True, the brain can work wonders in high gear. But it will do so
    much more if given the chance to slow down from time to time. Shifting the
    mind into lower gear can bring better health, inner calm, enhanced
    concentration and the ability to think more creatively." - Carl Honoré

    Another book I enjoyed this year is "Cloud Cuckoo Land" by Anthony Doerr.
    This book spans several centuries, telling the story of five characters who
    are all misfits in their different worlds. Anna, a girl in Constantinople
    in the fifteenth century, loves books in an era when girls were not taught
    or allowed to read. Omeir, a boy in Bulgaria around the same time, is born
    with a facial deformity that makes his society loathe him. Zeno, a young
    man in Idaho in the 1950s, is gay and grows up in the home of his religious
    stepmother. Seymour is a boy on the spectrum, growing up in Idaho in the
    2000s. His cognitive differences make him struggle in school and in
    society. Constance, a girl living in the post-apocalyptic future yearns for
    what she imagines to be the loveliness of earth when all around her are
    looking forward to a future on a different planet.
</p>
<p>
    All these characters are wonderfully portrayed. Weaving through these five
    stories are some common themes: love of books and stories, libraries as
    sanctuaries that provide refuge for misfits, and an ancient mythological
    story.
</p>
<p>
    I relate to these characters that are
    outsiders in their own realms - I have been one, personally and professionally, most of my life. 
    Doerr's writing is mesmerizing, and his
    words dance through your mind. The storytelling is unique. As you read
    more, more layers are peeled, and more truths and structures are
    revealed. This process of slow understanding is like solving a puzzle,
    something that is quite rewarding and refreshing.

    back to him, of a man transformed into a donkey, then a fish, then a crow,
    journeying across earth, ocean, and stars to find a land without suffering,
    only to choose to return home in the end, and live a last few years among
    his animals." - Anthony Doerr

<h5>
    Other books I'd recommend from my reading this year
</h5>
<p>
    <strong>Mama's Last Hug</strong>
    : Written by primate researcher Frans de Waal, this book makes the case
    that emotions and traits typically claimed to be uniquely human - like joy,
    empathy, shame, mirth, and free will - are found in animals too. Rats like
    to be tickled. Cows feel separation anxiety. Pigs feel hope. Monkeys expect
    fairness. The author lays out an account of these from his decades-long
    research. I love books that teach me new things and help me see the world
    with new eyes, and this book certainly did that.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Midnight Library</strong>
    : This is a magical novel by Matt Haig about life choices. Nora Seed, the
    protagonist, is given a chance - as she stands between life and death - to
    make some of the choices that she regrets not making in her life. As she
    makes each of them now, she gets to see where they might have led her to.
    The book helps you think deeply about regrets. It reminds you to cherish
    what you have at the present moment, much like the parable from Greek
    mythology in Cloud Cuckoo Land.

<p>
    For me, 2021 has been a fertile year for reading. I am grateful that I could 
    create space in my life to read books. Reading 
    gives me new insights and perspectives, sharpens my empathy, and is great
    for my mental health. If you like reading too, I hope you can do more of it in 2022. Happy reading, folks!
