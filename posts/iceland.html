title: Appreciate hot showers, and other life lessons
date: Sep 16, 2021
---
<p>
    I once lived in an ancient house that had no running water. The kitchen was
    dark, cave-like, with cold stone floors. It had a square corner with a
    drain set on the floor. My aunt washed vegetables, rice, plates and cups
    here.
</p>
<p>
    At nights, this corner became a lively place. Out of nowhere, you'd hear
    a croak. Then more croaks, and you'd see little, slimy, brown frogs
    swarming out of the drain. Then came cockroaches that crawled, and then the
    creepiest of all, cockroaches that flew.
</p>
<p>
    There were no bathrooms in the house too. To answer nature's calls, you had
    to draw water from a well and lug it to an "outhouse" in the backyard. In
    the outhouse, a single incandescent bulb dangled from the ceiling. Under
    its glare, you had to stay alert for snakes and scorpions. You heated water
    on wood stoves to wash yourselves if you wanted hot water, your clothes and hair 
    absorbing the smell if burning wood.
</p>
<p>
    I barely registered any of these as problems or "lack" back then. All I
    wanted, as a little girl that lived with her aunt, was warmth and love. I
    didn't mind that there was no easy access to bathrooms or water. I just
    accepted what I had.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, today I accept other things without ever noticing. In my current
    reality, I do not have to wait in line or draw water from a well for
    drinking water. My kitchen, though never spotlessly clean despite my
    concerted attempts, is well-lit and warm. Other than the occasional spider,
    I have no critter in my bathrooms. Hot water gushes out of my shower
    the moment I turn it on. But I do not notice them or the comforts they
    offer. I do not stop to appreciate or feel grateful. Except when I travel….
</p>
<p>
    I often travel with a single backpack over my back. Traveling with a single
    backpack means you have just your bare necessities with you. You learn to
    live minimally. On the other hand, when you do get access to more than
    those bare necessities, you take notice. And taking notice is half the
    battle toward appreciating.

    At the end of August, I backpacked in Iceland for two weeks, thru-hiking
    the famous Laugavegur trail.

<p>
    At the end of this 5-day adventure, I stayed in a hotel in Reykjavik where
    I could finally lay my head on soft, down pillows and sleep on a queen-size
    mattress covered in starched white sheets. I could shower in piping hot
    water and feel warm at the end of it. I could walk over to a restaurant and
    order myself a plate of spicy Pad Thai and sweet coconut milk tea. I
    noticed every single luxury after my deprivation, and I appreciated them
    more for it. This is one of the benefits of travel: you step briefly away
    from the things you are used to so they seem delightful to you when you
    return to them. Absence does make the heart grow fonder!
</p>
<p>
    Travel also gives you a mental break, something I needed sorely this year.
    When you travel, you make new friends, try new things, get new experiences.
    You learn about other countries and cultures.
</p>
<p>
    I learned a lot about Iceland in this trip. Firstly, that the country is
    breathtakingly beautiful. Secondly, that the land is as merciless as it is
    beautiful. The wind whips you about and the rain slashes your face. Iceland
    is on a hot spot where hot lava pours out of the earth, AND it straddles
    two tectonic plates. Just recently the country saw over

    >
        18000 earthquakes in a week
    </a>
    and an erupting volcano. Thanks to this inhospitable habitat, much
    vegetation doesn't survive here natively. But the resourceful Icelandic
    people have found a way to thrive. They grow vegetables in greenhouses
    using their abundant geothermal energy. They roof their houses in
    corrugated metal to circumvent the lack of wood. People, like in other
    Scandinavian countries, are exceedingly trusting of others. They leave
    their children in strollers outside cafes (gasp!) and do not lock their car
    - we accidentally stepped into someone else's car thinking it was our
    rental car. Contrary to any Nordic stereotypes, the people are warm and
    friendly. Veganism is well understood and catered to, even though the
    native Icelandic cuisine has some "interesting" foods like fermented shark.
    Even in rural areas and fishing towns, you can find something explicitly
    marked vegan.

<p>
   Any journey where you step out of
    your normal life and disconnect can widen your soul, and this was one such
    journey.  I also learned some deeper life lessons on this vacation. Here are a few.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    1. Find the truth for yourself
</h5>
<p>
    Reading up on other people's experiences is good (thank you for reading
    this far!), but know that each person perceives the world differently. What
    feels like climbing Mt. Everest for someone else might feel like just a
    moderately challenging hike for you, and vice versa. So do not let other
    people's worries, experiences, and fears stop you - on your adventures, in
    your career, in your life. Take precautions, learn the map ahead, but set
    out on your journey. Do not get stopped by your fears about how something
    is too daunting, too difficult, too beyond you.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    2. Focus on one step at a time.
</h5>
<p>
    The terrain ahead may be tricky to navigate, but if you keep your focus,
    look at where you are putting your feet, and keep calm, you will get
    through even the most challenging obstacles. Do not let your imaginations
    unrelated to just the few feet in front of you drain you.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    3. Use successes to fuel future successes.
</h5>

<br/>

<br/>
<p>
    If you climbed a difficult mountain or did something you were scared of
    before, feel proud of your accomplishment. Make a mental note and linger on
    what you just did. Next time you are up against something equally
    formidable, recall this success and use that to build up your
    self-confidence.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    4. See things in perspective
</h5>
<p>
    Just before I left Iceland, I went to see a live volcano called
    Fagradalsfjall. The volcano had started erupting in March of this year and
    had been spewing sulfuric steam, ash, and molten magma ever since.
</p>
<p>
    I had never seen anything like it before - the viscous magma, its slow
    pace, the sizzle, the rising steam, the singeing heat that got hotter as
    you closed in. I stared at its destruction in awe, realizing the smallness
    of my worries, my expectations, my disappointments, my squabbles, my pet
    peeves, and my self-criticism.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    Volcanoes are powerful, timeless forces that shape this planet. They
    annihilate everything in their path, and that annihilation lays the base
    for more creation. In the face of such limitless, endless cycles of this
    universe, I realized our petty affairs are transitory. Everything shall
    pass one day, our most traumatizing worries, our biggest embarrassments,
    yur most intense crises, even our most beautiful works…
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    5. Understand what full life means to you and live it
</h5>
<p>
    In anticipation of my trip to Iceland, I binged on several Nordic-themed
    movies including the Amazon Prime series "Vikings". There is a point in the
    series, when a beloved character dies, you hear: "Weep not…I have lived a
    full life." What does living a full life mean to you? For me, it includes
    wins and losses, joys and sorrows, and LOTS and lots of rich experiences.
    Hiking the Laugavegur and road tripping around Iceland gave me many such
    wonderful experiences.
</p>
<p>
    There is so much that this beautiful world offers that we can fill our
    lives with. At the end of my life, I hope I can look back and feel the way
    this beloved character felt about hers. That I have lived a full life.

    After the hike, we rented a car and drove around the country for a week.
