title: Appreciate hot showers, and other life lessons
date: Sep 16, 2021
---
<p>
    I once lived in an ancient house that had no running water. The kitchen was
    dark, cave-like, with cold stone floors. It had a dank corner with a
    drain set on the floor. My aunt washed vegetables, rice, plates and cups
    here.
</p>
<p>
    At nights, this corner came alive. Out of nowhere, you'd hear
    a croak. Then more croaks, and you'd see little, slimy, brown frogs
    jumping out of the drain. Then came cockroaches that crawled, and then the
    creepiest of all, cockroaches that flew.
</p>
<p>
    There were no bathrooms in the house too. To answer nature's calls, you had
    to draw water from a well and lug it to an "outhouse" in the backyard. In
    the outhouse, a single yellow bulb dangling from the ceiling, you had to stay alert for snakes and scorpions. You heated water
    on wood stoves to wash yourself if you wanted hot water, your clothes and hair 
    absorbing the smell of burning wood.
</p>
<p>
    I barely registered any of these as problems or "lack" back then. All I
    wanted, as a little girl that lived with her aunt, was warmth and love. I
    didn't mind that there was no easy access to bathrooms or water. I just
    accepted what I had.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, today I accept other things without ever noticing. In my current
    reality, I do not have to wait in line or draw water from a well for
    drinking water. My kitchen, though never spotlessly clean despite my
    concerted attempts, is well-lit and warm. Other than the occasional spider,
    I have no critter in my bathrooms. Hot water gushes out of my shower
    the moment I turn it on. But I do not notice them or the comforts they
    offer. I do not stop to appreciate or feel grateful. Except when I travelâ€¦.
</p>
<p>
    I often travel with a single backpack over my back. Traveling with a single
    backpack means you have little more than your bare necessities with you. You learn to
    live minimally. On the other hand, when you do get access to more than
    those bare necessities, you take notice. And taking notice is half the
    battle toward appreciating.

    In August, I backpacked in Iceland for two weeks, thru-hiking
    the famous Laugavegur trail. I walked every day, my only concerns circling 
    on what to eat, where to sleep, and when to wash up. I stayed at rustic mountain huts every night. 
    I cooked meals in the hut kitchens using only what I had within my backpack. 
    I slept on hard mattresses that were under 3-feet wide. 
    I showered in hot water most days, but there was nothing cozy or warming about these showers. 
    I got cold before I could step into my clothes again.

    At the end of this 5-day adventure, I stayed in a hotel in Reykjavik where
    I could finally lay my head on soft, down pillows and sleep on a queen-size
    mattress covered in starched white sheets. I could shower in piping hot
    water and feel warm at the end of it. I could walk over to a restaurant and
    order myself a plate of spicy Pad Thai and sweet coconut milk tea. I
    noticed and appreciated every single luxury after my minimal existence on the trail. 
    </p>
    <p>This is one of the benefits of consciously stepping away: familiar things seem more delightful when you
    come back to them. I needed to step away this 
    year for more than that feeling of appreciation. I needed a mental break after some family and health crises. 
    I decided on traveling to Iceland because Iceland had a solid A on vaccination rates, and it is a small, 
    spectacular country.
</p>
<p>
    I learned a lot about Iceland in this trip. Firstly, that the country is
    breathtakingly beautiful. Secondly, that the land is as merciless as it is
    beautiful. The wind whips you about and the rain slashes your face. Iceland
    is on a hot spot where hot lava pours out of the earth, AND it straddles
    two tectonic plates. Just recently the country saw over

    >
        18000 earthquakes in a week
    </a>
    and an erupting volcano. Thanks to this inhospitable habitat, much
    vegetation doesn't survive here natively. But the resourceful Icelandic
    people have found a way to thrive. They grow vegetables in greenhouses
    using their abundant geothermal energy. They roof their houses in
    corrugated metal to circumvent the lack of wood. People, like in other
    Scandinavian countries, are exceedingly trusting of others. Veganism is well understood and catered to, 
    even though the native Icelandic cuisine has some "interesting" foods like fermented shark.

   I gained more than such surface knowledge about Iceland, of course. Any journey where you step out of
    your normal life and disconnect can widen your soul, and this was one such
    journey.

    Before I left for Iceland, I had - true to form - done a ton of research about
    hiking the Laugavegur and an extension to it called the Fimmvorduhals. Some
    of what I saw on YouTube and read online scared the guts out of me. Many people obsessed over the 
    dangers of the river
    crossings, billed the exposed ridges as daunting. I worried that
    some sections of the trail were too technical for me. But I firmed up my
    resolve and set out on the journey anyway. As I walked, I
    realized how much of my experience was different from others. River crossings felt refreshing, and the 
    sections that I had worried about the most were not that scary. So my first lesson was to always 
    <strong>
        seek the truth for myself and not let other people's fears and worries stop me.
    </strong>
    This was true for my hike, but it is equally true in work and life as
    well.
</p>
<p>
    The first day on the Laugavegur trail was the steepest ascent of the trip.
    It was made further intense by the heavy fog that had descended on us and
    the cutting wind that pushed us about. The ascents were steep, parts with
    loose volcanic dirt and no purchase for the feet. Nikki, a woman I had
    befriended at the first hut, told me something that day that helped me
    throughout the journey.
    <strong>
        Focus on one step at a time and just pay attention to where you put
        your feet - nothing else.
    </strong>
    The terrain ahead may be tricky to navigate, but if you keep your focus,
    look at where you are putting your feet, and keep calm, you will get
    through even the most challenging obstacles. Do not let your imaginations
    unrelated to just the few feet in front of you drain you.
</p>
<p>Another life lesson that traveling in Iceland reminded me of was how much was 
    beyond my measly control, and how it is <b>better to deal with what comes 
        my way than to expect everything to go picture perfect according to plan.
    </b> Iceland can offer you shimmering blue skies and a gentle breeze one day, and the very 
    next day, you can wake up to heavy clouds and a roaring storm. You take the ups with the downs, and learn to 
    weave yourself a good day regardless. You walk and see things when you can walk and see things. You sip your tea 
    and stay warm when it becomes too dangerous or ghastly to go out. You come to be at peace with not
    being able to control everything around you. 
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of things beyond your control, on my last day on Iceland, I went to see a live volcano called
    Fagradalsfjall. The volcano had started erupting in March this year and
    had been spewing sulfuric steam, ash, and molten magma ever since. I had
    never seen anything like it before - the viscous magma, its slow pace, the
    sizzle, the rising steam, the singeing heat that got hotter as you closed
    in. I stared at its destruction in awe, realizing the smallness of my
    worries, my expectations, my disappointments, my squabbles, my pet peeves,
    and my self-criticism.

<p>
    Volcanoes are powerful, timeless forces that shape this planet. They
    annihilate everything in their path, and that annihilation lays the base
    for more creation. 
    In the face of such limitless, endless cycles of this universe, I
        realized our petty affairs are transitory.
    Everything shall pass one day, our most traumatizing worries, our biggest
    embarrassments, our most intense crises, even some of our most beautiful worksâ€¦It is good to always 
    <strong>see things in perspective.
</strong>
   
</p>
<p>
    Hiking the Laugavegur and road tripping around Iceland taught me much and gave me many 
    wonderful experiences. Thinking back on it, I am reminded of the moment 
    when a beloved character dies in the gripping Amazon Prime series "Vikings". She says:
    "Weep notâ€¦I have lived a full life." What does living a full life mean to me? What does it mean to you?
</p>
<p>
    There is so much that this beautiful world offers that we can fill our
    lives with. At the end of my life, I hope I can look back and feel the way
    this beloved character felt about hers. That I have lived a full life.
