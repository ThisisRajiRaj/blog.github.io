title: At the UN - A Few Words on Equality, Inclusion, and Tech Education
date: March 19, 2023
---

<p>
    The first time I heard about the UN was when I was a wide-eyed girl in a small town in India. I had a shaky 
    grip of the English language. The Egyptian statesman Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the UN's Secretary General. I had
    just
    learned about the formation of the UN and how it was an organization dedicated to world peace and
    security. I was awed. I didn&rsquo;t imagine, as a high schooler then, that I&rsquo;d visit the UN one day, let
    alone be a
    speaker there. So, when I was invited to speak at a panel there &ndash; not just speak, but speak on the topic of
    empowering girls
    and women through digital education &ndash; I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>
    The day of my UN panel dawned grey and cold. As I headed out of my hotel, a biting wind cut into my skin, feeling
    like a million needles. There was a persistent rain mixed with drifting soft snowflakes. </p>

    I ducked into a takeaway joint near my hotel and - struck by the tenor of the
    activity inside &ndash; picked up a quick breakfast and a cup of coffee to go. Struggling with the umbrella on my
    one gloved hand and the coffee cup on the
    other, trying simultaneously to fiddle with my phone to get more information on the exact location of my session, I
    scurried over to the official headquarters of the United Nations.</p>
<p>
    To be in that building, with so many people from around the world, warmed my heart. I met several interesting people
    doing important work for humanity: Jennifer from Kenya spoke about how difficult it was for disabled people to
    access technology. Cathy from Congo and Carole from Cameroon spoke about gender issues in Central Africa.
    Talita spoke about being a woman in tech in Brazil. So many rich conversations, and so much I learned from these impressive women!
    
</p><p>My panel had a 
    selection of "Power Women" - all leaders in technology. Other than myself, we had Kranthi Darapu, a
    General Manager at Amazon; Ali Heron, the CTO of Petal; Anna Kowalczuk, a VP at MongoDB. Kate Watts, the moderator
    of our panel asked us all many questions that day. But the one that
    rounded up our session sums
    it up for me:
    <strong>what advice did we have for the policy makers gathered in that room that day to get more women into
        tech?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When I grew up, as I describe in my book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/daring">Daring to be
        Different&rdquo;</a>, I faced many gender-based prejudices. I could only eat after all the men in the house had
    been fed. I had to clean up after my brother. When I got older, my place in the world was supposed to be that of a
    wife, a mother, a
    daughter-in-law. I was supposed to not argue, to be pleasing and quiet. Despite all that, I was never told I would
    not be good at Math and Science. When I came to North America, and I heard that girls growing up here routinely pick
    up that societal message, I realized that different cultures struggle with inequalities in different ways.</p>



<br />
<p>
<div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
        Inequality may be a shared experience across cultures, but each culture struggles with inequality in its own
        unique way.
    </blockquote>
</div>

</p>
<br />
<p>
    For instance, did you know that even among women, marginalized groups like older women, rural women, and women with
    disabilities face significantly greater barriers to connectivity? Policies that will work to bring more women into
    tech (and help them thrive there)
    in Kenya may not be the same as
    what will be needed in India or USA or Iran. We need to sift for our shared challenges and recommend policies to
    address those. But one size seldom fits all when it comes to such a heterogenous group.
</p>
<p>Across the board, it is
    important for us
    to build flexibility into work, assist with family care, to build recruiting pipelines for diverse individuals, to
    foster an inclusive environment, and create opportunities for professional development. But we should also not lose
    sight of the fact that the nature of challenges are different in different places. Our response to global challenges
    should be nuanced. We need to build uniquely local
    solutions for uniquely local problems. This is why we need to have local champions and leaders, and we need to make
    sure
    that their voices are heard.</p>
<p>
    It was truly an honor for me to be at the UN sharing my perspectives on a topic that is so close to my heart.</p>

    I was in NYC for my UN event. But the universe has a way of surprising you with serendipity. It so happened that,
    that week, the NY chapter of the Women at Microsoft Employee Resource Group had been invited to ring the closing
    bell at NASDAQ! I had presented a talk to this group at lunchtime and the women invited me to join them at NASDAQ.
    Of course, I said yes.</p>
<p>
    I love New York. It always galvanizes me and gets me to do more. The key is to be open to these new experiences that
    come your way. From hanging out with friends to speaking at the UN to the talk I gave at Microsoft to
    the NASDAQ closing bell, NY gave me magical few days last week.
    I can't wait to return!</p>
