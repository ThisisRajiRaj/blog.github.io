title: What I talked about when I was asked to talk at the UN about empowering women through tech
date: March 19, 2023

<p>
    Do you have someone in your life that is so kind that you feel like you're in the presence of pure goodness?</p>
<p>
    I have a few such folks in my life, but the one that stuns me every time with her kindness is my friend Jane.</p>
<p>
    Jane is my running friend. I have run with her for over 10 years now, and she is very dear to me. Recently, Jane
    volunteered to accompany me on my trip to New York. It was the first time I was going to speak at the United Nations
    on a panel on empowering women and girls through tech. Jane, the kindest soul I know, wanted to be there with me and
    FOR me.</p>
<p>
    The first time I had heard about the UN was when I was a wide-eyed girl in a small town in India. I had an arthritic
    grip of the English language. The Egyptian statesman Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the UN's Secretary General. I had
    just
    learned about the formation of the UN and how it was an organization dedicated to world peace and
    security. I was awed. I didn&rsquo;t imagine, as a high schooler then, that I&rsquo;d even visit the UN one day, let
    alone be a
    speaker there. So, when I was invited to speak &ndash; not just speak, but speak on the topic of empowering girls
    and women through digital education &ndash; I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>
    The day of my UN talk dawned grey and cold. As we headed out of our hotel, a biting wind cut into my skin, feeling
    like a million needles. There was a persistent rain mixed with drifting soft snowflakes. In Seattle, I usually carry
    a rain jacket with me on such days. In NY, because I was dressed in fine clothes, I took
    an umbrella with me.</p>

<p>
    On our way to the UN, we ducked into a takeaway joint close by and - struck by the tenor of the
    activity inside &ndash; we picked up a quick breakfast and a cup of coffee to go. Struggling with the umbrella on my
    one gloved hand and the coffee cup on the
    other, trying simultaneously to fiddle with my phone to get more information on the exact location of my session, we
    scurried over to the official headquarters of the United Nations.</p>
<p>
    To be in that building, with so many people from around the world, warmed my heart. This world is beautiful in its
    diversity. My panel was a wonderful selection of "Power Women" - all execs in technology. We had Kranthi Darapu, a
    General Manager at Amazon; Ali Heron, the CTO of Petal; Anna Kowalczuk, a VP at MongoDB. Kate Watts, the moderator
    of my panel asked us all many questions that day. But the one that
    rounded up our session sums
    it up for me:
    <strong>what advice did I have for the policy makers gathered in that room that day to get more women into
        tech?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When I grew up, as I describe in my book &ldquo;<a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/daring">Daring to be
        Different&rdquo;</a>, I faced many gender-based prejudices. I could only eat after all the men in the house had
    been fed. I had to clean up after my brother. When I got older, my place in the world was supposed to be that of a
    wife, a mother, a
    daughter-in-law. I was supposed to not argue, to be pleasing and quiet. Despite all that, I was never told I would
    not be good at Math and Science. When I came to North America, and I heard that girls growing up here routinely pick
    up that societal message, I realized that different cultures struggle with inequalities in different ways.</p>



<br />
<p>
<div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
        Inequalities may be a shared experience across cultures, but each culture struggles with inequality in its own
        unique way.
    </blockquote>
</div>

</p>
<br />
<p>
    Policies that will work to bring more women into tech (and help them thrive there) in Kenya may not be the same as
    what will be needed in India or USA or Iran. We need to sift for our shared experiences and recommend policies to
    address those.Bbut one size seldom fits all when it comes to heterogeneity. Across the board, it is important for us
    to build flexibility into work, assist with family care, to build recruiting pipelines for diverse individuals, to
    foster an inclusive environment, and create opportunities for professional development. But we should also not lose
    sight of the fact that the nature of challenges are different in different places. Our response to global challenges
    should be nuanced. We need to build uniquely local
    solutions for uniquely local problems. This is why it is important to have local champions and leaders and make sure
    their voice is heard.</p>
<p>
    It was truly an honor for me to be at the UN sharing my perspectives on a topic that is so close to my heart.</p>

    I was in NYC for my UN event. But the universe has a way of surprising you with serendipity. It so happened that,
    that week, the NY chapter of the Women at Microsoft Employee Resource Group had been invited to ring the closing
    bell at NASDAQ! I had presented a talk to this group at lunchtime and the women invited me to join them at NASDAQ.
    Of course, I said yes.</p>
<p>
    I love New York. It always galvanizes me and gets me to do more. The key is to be open to these new experiences that
    come your way. From hanging out with my lovely friend Jane to speaking at the UN to the talk I gave at Microsoft to
    the NASDAQ closing bell to getting to catch up with some family and friends, NY gave me magical few days last week.
    I am always to waiting to return to one of my favorite cities in the world.</p>

    Since you have now read my version of this trip, let's turn to how AI would tell you this story. I present OpenAI,
    the future raconteur.
