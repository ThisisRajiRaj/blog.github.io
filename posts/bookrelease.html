<p>For every writer, there comes a thrilling time when they are able to see their first book published. For this writer, that moment has just arrived!
</p>
<p>
    Several of you have been devoted readers of my blog or at least have enjoyed some of my writing - here on my website or in magazines and elsewhere. This new 
    book that I have just published, titled <em>Daring to be Different: Stories and Tips from a Woman Leader in Tech</em>, is a collection of my personal and professional essays. Some of them have been previously seen here and a few are brand new, never-before-published.
</p>
<p>
    Here are few sample pages from the book.

I wrote this book to share my lived experience, stories, and practical tips...and hopefully help the next generation of leaders in technology to dream big and overcome their anxieties and challenges. While the book has a lot of my own stories, I didn't write it as my memoir, and it is not written to be about me. This book is a way for me to share my  path while illustrating an important point for the future: you can overcome the challenges in front of you, with some help, and build yourself a meaningful, fabulous life. 
</p>
<p>I hope you read the book and enjoy it.</p>
