        As an engineer and subsequently a leader at Microsoft, I have always constantly looked around to see what the
        world - my team, my customers, my company - is calling me to do. This mindset to look for
        useful problems to solve, and solving them, has helped me tremendously. It has helped me grow in my career and derive satisfaction from my work. Contrary to popular advice to make clear and detailed career development plans, I have
        never made one in my life. At least not one that has been useful. Making meticulous long-term plans might work for some, but it
        has not been how I have navigated my career.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my career, I have always followed my curiosity, my heart, and what the world is asking me to do at any
        given moment.
    </p>
    <p>After the release of my last book <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Different-Stories-Woman-Leader-ebook/dp/B0BNKNWPY8>"></a>Daring to be
        Different: Stories and Tips from a Woman Leader in Tech"</a>, when organizations and individuals asked me to
        share the skills I explored in the book, I started thinking of a way I could tailor the material and make it
        more
        hands-on for people. I realized that the world was calling me to do exactly that as the next step with the book.
        My original book was intended to share my career journey and the lessons I had picked up
        along the way. I had woven candid stories from my personal and professional life with the insights they gave me.
        I realized that, in order to teach these skills in a more focused way and help them stick better, a workshop
        format where the audiences can work on their own career plans would be most helpful.

    </p>
    <p>That's how the idea for this next upcoming book came to me. </p>

    <p>My second book in the "Daring to be Different" series is all about YOU the reader. While the original book
        offered the skills I consider essential as subtext in the stories I share, this new book names these skills one
        by one. It also offers a way for you to reflect on your dreams, situations, goals, and obstacles, and create a
        personal plan that is tailored to help you in your own journey. You get to answer carefully crafted questions
        and know more about yourself: what you strengths are and how you can create a system to develop your areas of
        growth.</p>

            "This short book is a gem! Raji has distilled eight skills out of her life and
            career experiences that really resonated with me as I think through my
            life. The exercises and questions she has posed to the reader for reflection
            are excellent. I really enjoyed going through the book, and I am positive
            if you put in the work and reflect, then you will find a lot of value and
            discover yourself, and what makes you tick and what is holding you
            back. This is definitely a book that can go on my shelf as a reference and
            help-book that I can keep coming back and get something new out of
            every time I reflect with a current challenge."

    <p>I have designed this book to be a fun, memorable, and a meditative experience. My goal is that my readers will
        take the time to invest in themselves - not once but going back to the book repeatedly and as often as needed.
        My hope is that you find the book helpful in teaching you a bit more about yourself and how you can use your
        strengths to catapult in your career. </p>
    <p>I am hosting an online workshop on May 19th where you will get early access to this upcoming book. Register <a
