title: Notes from a 25-day walk
date: October 29, 2022
---
<p>
    Recently we finished a 25-day trip, walking 440 Km across Switzerland. The
    journey was along a (mostly) well-marked trail, through charming villages,
    and crossing 16 mountain passes. It was a difficult trek, possibly the most
    difficult thing I have ever done.

    Any journey of such magnitude teaches you a few things. John Muir famously
    said that in every walk in nature, one receives far more than he seeks.
    More than the stupendous scenery we walked through, the people we met along
    the way, the memories we made, I cherish the life lessons I internalized
    during this trip. Here are three that I want to share with you today.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    Keep one foot in front of another
</h4>
<p>
    There were exactly two locations on Via Alpina 1 when I almost broke into
    tears. In both cases, my problem was the fear of what is to come. A 400+ KM
    trek up and down Swiss Alps was certainly a daunting journey from the
    start. When I was on the verge of tears, it was that fear - the fear of how
    much more I had to do, the worry that what I had done so far, however
    arduous, was just a drop in the bucket - that inflamed my imagination.
</p>
<p>
    One of those times was on a dismal day when we had walked over a dozen
    kilometers. The wind was howling in our ears. We were drenched by sheets of
    driving rain. Our path had taken us on steep rollers. Part of the footpath
    had turned to muck and dung and the rest of it was waterlogged. Thanks to
    low clouds that beset us, there was no view for distraction. We had to plod
    along, keeping our heads down and our jackets braced around us. It was one
    of the toughest days we had encountered thus far.
</p>
<p>
    I stopped, trembling in the bitter wind, and said I didn't want to carry
    on. "How much more to go?" I asked with exasperation, "When will we get to
    the freaking pass?"
</p>
<p>
    I was ready to give up. I would have given up if it had not been for the
    words that would become my mantra during more such tough moments on our
    trek.
</p>
<p>
    "We get there when we get there," my partner - who was equally exhausted -
    told me, as much for me as for himself. "We just need to keep putting one
    foot in front of another and make progress".
</p>
<p>
    There are many instances where making such slow progress - one foot at a
    time - is not the way to go. When taking a hammer to the box that traps you
    is better than chipping at it with a pencil. But, in this case, patience
    and perseverance were definitely the way to go. I ate a few sweet things
    from my backpack, swigged some water, and resolved to move. One foot in
    front of another. I stopped focusing on the future and how much more to go,
    how many more passes to climb, and how formidable this entire trek was.
    Gradually we made progress. Not just that day, but enough to complete the
    entire trek.
</p>
<p>
    You get there when you get there. If you are feeling intimidated by or
    impatient about whatever it is in front of you - how much more to do with
    your life, your career, your work; how much more to go before you lose
    those extra pounds or gain that strength you want; how many more days before your body heals
    from that illness - stay patient and persevere. Put one metaphoric foot in
    front of another. You get there when you get here. Trust yourself and your
    inner strength.
</p>

<h4>
    By helping others, you help yourself
</h4>

<br/>
<p>
    The day we climbed over one of the toughest passes of the trek - the
    Hohtürli - we were joined by a gentleman who happened to live less than
    three miles from us back in the US. We met him in a hostel in the previous
    night and struck up a conversation over dinner. As we ate our filling Rosti
    and drank our mugs of steaming chocolate, he told us that he had a
    debilitating fear of heights. This was worrying because - while there was
    not a lot of exposure on our route in general - the next section was the
    highest we would climb to.
</p>
<p>
    So, the next day, as we trekked, we kept an eye on him. He stuck close to
    us, talking about this and that, and following our lead mostly where the
    trail became faint. I saw him occasionally get on all fours to crawl
    through the steepest sections with scary drop-offs. What was remarkable was
    how much I had stopped thinking about myself and instead thought about him
    that day: Was he ok? Was the pace too much for him? Should we take a break
    so he could relax? And so on…
</p>
<p>
    Before starting on Via Alpina 1, there were three sections I had dreaded
    the most, and the Hohtürli was number one on that list. However, at the end
    of day, as I reflected, the pass had not been a scary at all. My heart had
    become too full with care and concern for another human being that it had
    forgotten to fear for myself. To me that day was a wonderful one, a
    successful one, not because I had climbed over the tallest pass on the
    trek, but because we had helped someone overcome his fear.
</p>
<p>
    Adam Grant in his book Give and Take says, "the more I help out, the more
    successful I become. But I measure success in what it has done for the
    people around me. That is the real accolade." That day was a good reminder
    that helping people takes you out of the limited cardboard box of caring
    about yourself. It makes you more expansive and happier. It empowers others
    to become more expansive and happier. What more reason do we need to give
    more to the world?
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    You do not need too much for happiness
</h4>
<p>
    When I go on these backpacking trips, I am reminded of how little I need to
    live happily. All I live off of, for those few days, is whatever I carry in
    my backpack. My life becomes extremely simplified. There is no TV remote to
    lose, no plumbing to fix, no loads of laundry to do, no email to clear. More importantly,
    there are no worries about work or about what someone else is thinking or
    not thinking about you. There is just what I need to stay warm, fed,
    watered, and clean. There is a wondrous sense of freedom in that
    simplicity.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, cutting out of *all* your life clutter is likely to be only a
    temporary thing. There is a tenet in Indian philosophy that such withdrawal
    from society cannot make you happier or a better person. It is by learning
    how to manage your mind in the middle of all your mental, emotional, and
    societal clutter that you can achieve lasting peace. But such breaks in
    nature, however brief they are, remind you of how little you need and
    really need to strive for in life. If you can find happiness in little,
    then do you really need that fancy job, that fancy house, that fancy car?

<p>
    Being in nature, staring at the glory of the milky way in a darkened sky,
    being astounded by lofty peaks and cascading glaciers, you feel humbled and
    grounded. It is therapeutic and energizing. When mountains call you, find a
    way to go!
