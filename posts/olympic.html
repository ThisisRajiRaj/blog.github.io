    My oldest nephew and I share a few traits. One of those is our love of rain
    and rainy places. Rain brings me joy.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps it is because I still cherish those rainy monsoon days in South
    India, when I was a little girl, when I didn't have to go to school because
    our roads always got flooded. I would instead sit by our window, listen to
    the pitter patter of the raindrops against our roof, watch the resident
    black raven on our mango tree, wet and clearly cold, huddle in its nest.
    I'd count the people that walked by on our street with their unfurled
    umbrellas and their hiked-up saris or dhotis. I'd make little paper boats
    that I'd float in puddles outside our door. Rain brings me memories of
    those quiet days, of running to our terrace to bring in the clothes drying
    on our clothesline, of peacocks dancing on roofs, of fragrant <i>pooris</i> - a
    fried leavened bread served with spicy potatoes - cooking in our kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    So it's no wonder that I love living in the Pacific Northwest where it
    rains for more months than not. It is no wonder that I love walking in
    forests and wild areas that are made lush by gallons and gallons of
    rainfall.
</p>
<p>
    One such wilderness I had the privilege of visiting this weekend is the
    Olympic National Park. The Olympic National Park is a protected wilderness
    close to Seattle with millions of acres of forests, hundreds of gorgeous
    hiking trails, cascading creeks and waterfalls, and mountains crowned with
    glaciers. The park is famed for its spellbinding natural beauty. When you
    camp and walk in the Olympics, you are in the company of massive Douglas
    firs, red cedars, hemlock and spruce trees, and thick and bright-green
    undergrowth. It is when I am in places like this that I cannot believe my
    good fortune in life.

    We hiked and camped there in the Olympic National Park this weekend. I had
    made a reservation at the Mora campground so that we had spot guaranteed
    for us when we arrived.

    The day we arrived at our campsite, though, we had a rude shock. Our tent,
    which we had not used for several years now, had several holes in the rain
    tarp. They were predicting rain for the weekend, and these holes meant that
    our sleeping bags and the inside of our tent would get wet. This was not a
    good situation to be in. We had to improvise and solve this problem.
</p>
<p>
    We figured that if we could get some duct tape, we could tape the holes and
    jerry-rig additional water proofing with our kitchen trash bags. We rushed
    to the local store. Thankfully the store was open and even more thankfully
    they had duct tape. We came back to our campsite and generously taped our
    rain tarp. That done, we crossed our fingers and hoped that we would stay
    dry through the rainy night.
</p>
<p>
    We mostly did.
</p>
<p>
    Now you could say that we could have avoided the whole disaster and the
    attendant drama if we had been a bit more prepared. If only we had tested
    our tent before leaving home, we would have realized there were holes in
    our tarp. But we didn't and there is no point in regret - you cannot change
    the past. What is more useful is this: if you have not prepared for
    something, you should improvise and problem solve, think on your feet. Not
    just for your camping emergencies, but for work situations as well. This is
    something that I often tell the folks that mentor at work. While there is a
    place for preparation - and I don't advocate anyone being completely
    unprepared - it is vital to be ok with handling situations that you have
    not prepared for. This skill becomes increasingly important as you become
    more senior in your career and take on leadership roles.
</p>

    Despite the jerry-rigged tent (and the somewhat odd and uneven campsite we
    ended up with), we really enjoyed our camping and hiking trip in the
    Olympic National Park. Being in nature always centers me. Sleeping under
    open skies, waking up to the dawn chorus of songbirds, falling asleep to
    the sound of raindrops on the tent fabric - these are downright magical.
    Camping and living a rustic life, even for just a few days, helps me see
    how little I need to live my life. At the same time, I get to see how many
    things are absolutely essential to me: warm clothes, safe shelter, hot
    meals, meaningful connection with other human beings, and above all, the
    freedom to live my life the way I want it. These are some of the things
    that sustain me. Many other things that I am used to in my everyday life,
    maybe even addicted to - our big-screen TV, our two-car garage, my scented
    candles, gourmet meals - these are luxuries. These luxuries perhaps are
    nice to lead a "good life" but can also be parted with if needed.
</p>
<p>
    Now that things are slowly opening up after the pandemic, I am glad that we
    can start traveling. If you can do it, I highly recommend retreating for a
    bit to some wild area in your vicinity. Camp or hike or simply find a quiet
    spot to sit and breathe. I think your mind will thank you.
