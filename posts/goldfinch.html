title: The Goldfinch - a book review

<p>
    In the year 2013, in a small, crowded bakery in New York's SoHo
neighborhood, a man born in the same year as me invented <em>cronuts. Cronuts </em>quickly became a sensation, first in NY
    and then around the world. The same year, the word <i>selfie</i> made it into the
    dictionary, and a NY publishing house brought to life a 771-page novel
    called <em>The Goldfinch</em>. This novel stole the hearts of many people
    worldwide, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 2014. Since that year, I have
    wanted to read it.
</p>
<p>
    Two things deterred me. First, the book is LONG. I have read
    longer books, for sure. But I know that committing to a long book is not to
    be taken lightly. You have to rapidly know if the material is worth it - if
    you are going to be absorbed, if the writing is going to hold water. A 700+
    page book can take anywhere from a few weeks to more than a month to
    finish. So, you better go into it with both eyes peeled wide. Secondly, the
    book is dark. You realize that as soon as you read the back cover. Here is 
    the Amazon.com description for <em>The Goldfinch</em>:

<br/>
<p><i>
    Theo Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident
    that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the
    family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park
    Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and
    tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing
    that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that
    ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community…He is
    alienated and in love -- and at the center of a narrowing, ever more
    dangerous circle. <em>The Goldfinch</em> is a mesmerizing,
    stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story
    of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention.

    My partner often jokes that I seem to take perverse pleasure in picking
    excruciatingly sad shows or movies on the days when it's my turn to pick our choice
    of TV (which he would also argue is ALL THE TIME). I am not one for shying
    away from sad movies or literature. But still, 771 pages of depressing
     material can become too much, especially if we are talking about
    reading that material over long winter nights after grueling days of work.
    For the last eight years or so, I have borrowed the book many times from
    the local library, only for the loan to expire before I felt propelled to
    read it.
</p>
<p>
    That changed this February when I finally worked up the courage to
    tackle the book. And what a delight it was to read it! I finished it in ten 
    days, often reading well into the night, crooking my neck against my pillow
    and resting my kindle against my partner's pillow. The book was - as the
    cliché goes - hard to put down.
</p>
<p>
    <em>The Goldfinch</em>
    is the coming-of-age tale of a boy who loses his mother in an accident.
    After that devastating loss, things happen to him. Things that are
    alternatively sad or lovely, but always interesting and incredibly crazy.
    He moves from classy homes in Upper East Side New York to a soulless house
    in Las Vegas back to the home of a kind, generous man in Downtown Manhattan
    - continually adjusting to his new circumstances, continually learning the
    rules of his new world, continually surviving whatever his new situations
    throw at him.
</p>
<p>
    Such is the life of displaced kids everywhere - children that survive the
    loss of one or both parents, those that have to leave their home in moments
    of large or small conflicts, children that are abandoned or sent to foster
    homes. I have heard this story in real life many times. I have endured it
    myself after losing my own mother. I have lived in houses where humans were at
    once kind and cruel. I have endured abuse at the hands of family while
    simultaneously finding the care and the space in their homes to make
    something of myself. Bad things have happened in my life, but so too have
    many good things.
</p>
<p>
    This is the case for Theo Decker, the protagonist of <em>The Goldfinch</em>
    , as well. Theo would receive the kindness of many strangers throughout the
    course of his life. He would fall in love with a girl. He would love a dog,
    and the dog would love him back to bits. He would experience heartwarming,
    staunch friendships. One of characters that would become his friend is
    Boris Pavlikovsky, a Ukrainian boy that is also motherless and drifting
    from place to place. Boris is one of the best characters I have ever had
    the pleasure of reading. There is something about that boy that draws you
    in - his quips, his loyalty, his affection, his rollercoaster of a life. 
</p>

<p>
    Theo would also face neglect, cruelty, and misfortune. He would do many bad things. He would
    become obsessed with art. In particular, with one painting - the painting of a little
    bird, a European goldfinch that is chained to its feeder. He would go to
    insane extents for the sake of that little painting.

    You can take the wrong path and it still comes out where you want to be? Or, spin it another way, 
    sometimes you can do everything wrong and it still turns out to be right?"

<p>This book is a
    bildungsroman, one boy's coming of age. It is about loss and grief. It is
    about trauma and the long-lasting impact of it. It is about broken
    childhoods and lives that become adrift due to reasons not in one's
    control. It is above all about love. Love of a child for his mom, love of
    beautiful objects, love of a friend, love of a little dog, love of a young
    boy for the "wrong girl". It is about love of life itself. For whatever
    else happens to our hero Theodore decker, he lives a most interesting life
    tumbling from high to low to high, surviving many catastrophes.

    I would not have thought I'd read such a long and heavy book in under two
    weeks. But the writing is beautiful, crisp, and taut. There are many layers to the story. The characters and
    the dialogues sparkle. Reading the book, I felt like I was reading a 
    Dostoevsky or a Dickens novel. One of these complex, meandering stories that leave a mark
    on your mind. If you want immerse yourself in a good story written by a
    master storyteller, I recommend this book to you. I hope you like it as
    much as I did.
