title: A pair of golden bangles
date: November 27, 2022
---
<p>
    I do not wear a lot of jewelry. Firstly, I find that jewelry chafes against
    my skin. When I run, when I work, when I cook, I find ornaments
    on my body irritating. Bangles rattle and move against my work desk,
    earrings interfere with my headphones, and necklaces rub my skin raw when I
    work out. If I wear any jewelry at all, it is usually tiny pearls or stones
    on my earlobes.
</p>
<p>
    It is traditional for middle-class Indian women, though, to wear an
    expected list of jewels: diamond or gold on your ears, at least one gold
    chain around your neck, and a few bangles, preferably made of gold. Being
    able to afford gold and diamonds is almost a matter of pride for my people.
    But even if you cannot afford expensive stones and metal, you adorn
    yourself with something. Glass bangles where gold is not possible. Pretty
    little "imitation" gold on your ears. A yellow thread around your neck that
    shows you are married.
</p>
<p>
    So, when I arrived in India recently with no jewelry on my body except my
    traditional wedding chain, I irked a lot of my family. As is often the case
    for women, I had to adhere to the many conventions on how to look and act.
    How much skin I could show (not too much), how I could prettify my face (no
    makeup except a dab of lily-white powder), how much jewelry to wear (not
    too little, but not too gaudy), how much to talk (not too much, but not too
    little), and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Having been out of India for over two decades now, and having become used
    to a lot of freedom, I didn't think too much about flouting the traditional
    rules. In fact, I have gotten so out of practice with Indian social norms
    that I didn't even think about them. I didn't pack any jewelry with me
    other than a pair of fake pearl studs. When I lost those studs in the hotel
    room I stayed in prior to arriving in Chennai, I shrugged it off as a small
    loss. I didn't think it would become a topic of conversation when I saw my
    family.
</p>
<p>
    Boy, was I mistaken.
</p>
<p>
    I heard a lot about my appearance from my relatives. "You have become too
    thin." "You should be wearing more Indian clothing at work." "Your hair is
    too short." "You should wear brighter clothes."
</p>
<p>
    But the one that was repeated most often was the complaint that I was not
    wearing any jewelry.
</p>
<p>
    Granted, the comment was not made with an intent to hurt, but with angst
    about what others might think of my impecunious appearance. It was my
    family's concern for my acceptance in society that usually triggered such
    talk.
</p>
<p>
    As I  do with a lot of unsolicited feedback from family, I brushed that
    comment aside. However, my dear, beautiful aunt - my father's sister -
    could not let it go when she heard someone make that remark in front of
    her. I assume that it stung her to hear her beloved niece being criticized.
    It likely also hurt her pride - my birth family was supposed to send me to
    my husband's home with wealth. Any comment about my lack of displayed
    wealth, therefore, could be seen as an affront to my birth family. Another
    reason why it likely bothered her was that the comment was made by a
    matron. A ton of respect is accorded to age in India, and anything that
    bothers an aged person is in need of being fixed immediately.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless, my aunt - my <em>athai -</em> immediately sprang into action.
    She sent me a note on WhatsApp as soon as she reached her house. "I am
    going to send you my gold bangles tomorrow. I don't want to hear you say
    anything other than that you'll wear it". I argued with her that it was not
    necessary. I told her that it was my own fault for not wearing the jewelry
    I have in a locker back in Seattle. I protested that if she wants to send
    me something, glass bangles would suffice.
</p>
<p>
    She would have none of it. The next day, my dad came to my mother-in-law's
    house with a pair of thin gold bangles and coral earrings. I was moved by
    my athai's desire to not have me hurt in any way, even in her own
    imagination. But I was even more struck by how small and fragile those gold
    bangles looked. My own bangles - the ones my father gifted to me on my
    wedding day - were solid like cuffs compared to these. My athai's bangles
    were like a piece of wire you might find in a regular toolbox. They were so
    tiny that I had to squeeze my hands tight to get them through the bangles.

<p>
    These bangles, it turned out, were the ones my athai had been gifted by her
    own parents on her wedding day in 1971. Her family had not been affluent at
    the time of her wedding, and yet had to fulfill the expectations of her
    trousseau: diamond earrings, gold bangles, gold necklaces, silk saris. They
    scrimped and saved to make it happen. My own father gave up his desire for
    post-graduate education. My grandmother took on small jobs in her
    neighborhood helping other families cook and clean. But still, what they
    could do for my aunt was a pale shadow of what - in the future - my father
    could do for me, or my athai could do for her own daughter. The bangles
    they could afford were wiry thin.
</p>

<p>
    I wore my athai's bangles as I reflected on their history. My ancestors had
    some wealth, lost a good portion of it in land disputes, and now we are on
    a positive trajectory again. When my aunt got married, we were not wealthy.
    Material wealth is good when you have it, but it is also quite transitory.
    It was not always with us in the past, and may not always be there with us
    in the future. It is useful to have an attitude of detachment to wealth.
</p>
<p>
    My athai is a down-to-earth person. She has lived through many trials in life. To her, being dutiful trumps almost
    anything else. Over the years, she has been a dutiful daughter, a dutiful
    wife, a dutiful daughter-in-law, a dutiful mother, a dutiful aunt to many
    of us, and a dutiful grandmother. She listens more than she talks, and she
    finds joy in the simplest of things. My heart filled with warmth when I
    thought of the love she has for me to want to protect me from even the most
    benign criticism.
</p>
<p>
    I took a picture of the bangles on my hand and sent it to her with a note
    of gratitude. I also asked her when I should return the bangles. "Should I
    send it through my dad when I see him at the airport?"
</p>
<p>
    "It's yours. It's my gift," she said, and added jokingly, "Do not talk
    about returning it if you don't want a good kick in the behind from me."
</p>
<p>
    "But, athai, it is gold. It is valuable!" I remonstrated.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes it is, and you are valuable to me," she said, "If your mother had been
    around, she would have done the same."
</p>
<p>
    I am fortunate to have such love around me. 
 </p>
 <p>I am back in the US now, with no intention of removing those bangles. Sure, they make the alarm go off when I have to pass through airport 
    security. They make themselves felt when I do physical things. But I treasure them for the love they embody. I treasure them because they remind me of my beautiful, 
    tenacious athai.
