title: What does it mean to be YOU?
date: January 22, 2022

<p>
    The last memory I have
    of my father-in-law is on a video call from a hospital three years ago. He was trying to look cheery
    and to wave at us. It broke my heart to see him so frail - he had been one
    of the strongest men I knew. I hoped he would get out of the hospital soon,
    fully recovered.
</p>
<p>
    Alas, the head injury he had sustained proved to be fatal. He deteriorated
    rapidly. Three days after that video call, he lost consciousness. A week
    later, his body shut down, and he left us.
</p>
<p>
    I think of my father-in-law often, partially because he had been such a
    solid presence in our lives just a little while ago. Now he was nothing but
    wistful memories scattered across many minds. I think
    of his life, but also of the manner of his death. Of how his consciousness
    had so swiftly turned into unconsciousness, separating him from the world
    and us from him. His body that had kept him going eighty plus years meant
    nothing to his life without his consciousness. Once he lost consciousness,
    it was a sharp slide into nothingness and death.
</p>
<p>
    Consciousness is instrumental to our lives. We are living organisms, just like
    whales and tortoises and parakeets, with our bodies made of blood and sinews and other organic matter. We are intelligent - in many
    ways the most intelligent species around. But it's our consciousness - our
    ability to be aware of our existence, our "self"- that really adds color
    to lives. But have you ever wondered what this "self" really is? Is it your
    body? Your brain? Your collection of memories, preferences, and stories?
</p>
<p>
    Your body - like mine and every other living being's - is made of trillions
    of cells. These cells strive and cooperate with each other to keep you
    alive. And yet, none of them are conscious. When they are put together in
    the exact configuration that makes up your individual body and mind, then
    suddenly, YOU are the result. How does that happen? How does consciousness
    arise out of the physiological units that make up a human?
</p>
<p>
    This is the topic of the book "Being You" by a British neuroscientist Anil
    Seth. The book is super well-written, very easy to understand even if you
    are not a neuroscientist.

    The core idea of the book is that consciousness
    is really a controlled hallucination of our minds. One can never experience reality as it truly
    is, the book posits. Reality gets delivered to our consciousness in the form of predictions
    - "best guesses" - offered by our brains and constrained by signals from
    our senses. Everything that is part of our subjective experience is a model
    built by our brains, the prediction machine that has evolved to
    keep us alive and kicking.
</p>
<p>
    It's not just how we perceive our world that is the result of this
    prediction machinery in our heads. It's our emotions, moods, and our sense of self too. Let's go
    back to the question of what your "self" really is. Dr. Seth talks about
    different dimensions of self - your narrative self (how you tell the story
    of your life), your social self (how you think others perceive you), your
    volitional self (you as a doer of actions out of your own will), your
    bodily self (your experience of being a body), and your perspectival self
    (how you view the world primarily through your singular perspective). But
    all of these different conceptions of selfhood ultimately are the result
    of the predictive machinery in your head to keep you going.

    "It seems as though the world is revealed directly to our conscious minds through our sensory organs. With this mindset, 
    it is natural to think of perception as a process of bottom-up feature detection—a “reading” of the world around us. 
    But what we actually perceive is a top-down, inside-out neuronal fantasy that is reined in by reality, 
    not a transparent window onto whatever that reality may be."

    "You could even say that we’re all hallucinating all the time. 
    It’s just that when we agree about our hallucinations, that’s what we call reality."

    Consciousness is a topic that has long
    fascinated me. I was fifteen years old when I first thought about it. I
    remember standing in front of a mirror, combing my hair, in the dark, low-ceilinged bedroom of
    my aunt's house. After a few strokes of the
    comb through my hair, I peered into the mirror, its sheen worn off from
    decades of use, and saw myself from a vantage point
    just above my head. It was eerie to suddenly become aware of myself as 
    a living, breathing entity, standing there, looking into the mirror. A question popped into my head: "Who
    is this person standing here?" 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, I knew who I was. I knew my name. I knew my history. I knew that
    my mother had died a few years ago and my relatives had taken me in to care
    for me. I knew my likes, my dislikes, and my aspirations. I knew math was
    my favorite subject and geography my least favorite. But these were not the
    answers to the question that crystallized in my head that day. What I was
    wondering then - and I have wondered many times since - was this:"Who was the 'I'  behind the conscious entity that was inhabiting this body?"
</p>

<p>
    This book "Being you" has been a captivating read to answer that question. It
    is a question that is not just interesting to answer out of curiosity,
    but it also has implications across many domains of life. For example, when is it ok to get someone off
    life support? How conscious are the different animals we experiment on? Can a
    machine become conscious? What is our responsibility in a world where
    machines are conscious? So many fascinating problems to solve for the world
    of tomorrow, and this book offers a ton of insights toward such problems.
