    Monica was a beautiful girl who had big aspirations for her future. She
    wanted to be a world-renowned model gracing the covers of GQ and Vogue. She
    wanted to make something of herself, to stand on her own two legs. She
    wanted to be an entrepreneur like her dad. She
    thought the fashion industry was just like any other. You work hard, you seize
    opportunities, you do courageous things, you go the extra mile, and you
    will be successful. With those big dreams, she started her own modeling
    business when she was just twenty-one.
</p>
<p>
    Barely a year later, she was raped by a photographer.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't know much about the modeling industry until I spoke to Monica this
    week. I had seen the glitter and the shiny hair and the fabulous clothes. I
    had imagined perfumed and beautifully lit rooms where professionals treated
    each other, well, professionally. I am an amateur photographer myself, and
    I love capturing pictures of beautiful things and people. I did not know
    about the extent of the seedy underbelly of that industry until now.
</p>
<p>
    Monica, unfortunately, had come to know all about it. Since she was two
    years old, she had been groomed in the modeling world. Her mother had been pushy and ambitious for her -
    even toxic. She grew up learning
    to eat salads. She snacked on celery, carrot sticks, and sugar-free gum
    when she felt hungry. By the time she was twenty, her body image had been rent to
    tatters, and she was less than 100 lbs.
</p>
<p>
    Monica's dad had been an entrepreneur before he died of cancer when she was
    just eleven. She had looked up to him. After a few years of working with
    modeling agencies for her contracts, her desire to be like her dad, the
    entrepreneur, took over. She took the leap one day. She left the modeling
    agency and started her own business. Initially, it had felt normal, just
    like how it had been when she had worked under the auspices of agencies.
    But slowly, the tone of her photoshoots began to shift.
</p>
<p>
    Her photographers started asking her to model in skimpier clothes, in
    risqu√© poses. They offered her extra money (one of them offered her $200)
    and plum placements in prestigious magazines for sexual favors after her
    shoots. For a young Monica, driven to succeed, these offers sounded par for
    the course. She needed to bold things, in her mind, to make her dreams come
    true.
</p>
<p>
    She took these offers, and gradually found herself sucked into a full-on
    trafficking ring, where a network of predators was kept informed of models who were
    self-employed and could easily be taken advantage of. What she didn't
    realize was that these assignments were not normal, that she was being
    trafficked as she accepted each of them. She was paddling along as fast as
    she could and went where the current took her. Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey
    Weinstein had not become household names yet. And then there was that one
    time, when she refused to go along with the asks for sexual favors, when a
    photographer assaulted and raped her.
</p>
<p>
    She tried to put the rape behind her and started working non-stop. She was
    eating even less than before. Her life had become a dizzying swoon, like a
    movie scene where cacophony reigns and the world spins in a vortex of
    colors and lights. Her body started to act up against the abuse it was
    enduring. She had to be rushed to the hospital. They put her on rehab for a
    few months. As rehab progressed, she slowed down and started reflecting on
    her life. She started volunteering her time for non-profits. That was when
    - through her conversation with Brenda Wells, the founder of i-5 Freedom
    Network - she started to realize that she had been a victim of sex
    trafficking. In fact, she had been trafficked for close to four years by then.
</p>
<p>
    Gradually, she started to pick up the pieces of her life. She met Cynthia
    Luvlee-Austin, the visionary behind Shyne SD, a non-profit with a mission
    to empower survivors of trafficking, gender violence, and abuse to flourish as entrepreneurs.
    Monica's life started to turn around. The community and the mentorship from Shyne SD helped.
</p>
<p>
    Today Monica speaks internationally from her firsthand experience about sex
    trafficking. She is a life coach that works with women that have endured
    and vanquished different categories of exploitation, abuse, and violence.
    She dreams of giving a TED talk one day, of building a thriving coaching
    business, of continuing to shine light on fellow survivors, and of
    inspiring them to reach for more.
</p>
<p>
    I was moved to tears listening to Monica. Her story, though, is just one
    story. There are so many other women that are continuing to endure the
    evils of trafficking.
</p>
<p>
    Around the world, traffickers trap people with false promises of
    opportunities, by withholding identification, using violence, and in many
    other ways. Human trafficking is the third biggest crime industry
    internationally. 8 in 10 of its victims are women or girls. 50% of people that are
    trafficked are children, and on average they enter the sex trade between
    the ages of twelve and fourteen. While it is hard to estimate the true
    extent of the issue, since many cases are not reported, around 700,000
    people are trafficked every year across international boundaries. That is
    about the size of the entire population of the city of Seattle, trapped in
    circumstances that destroy their mental, financial, and physical well-being
    slowly.
</p>
<p>
    Survivors of trafficking face an uphill slog to get back on their feet.
    They battle taboos and protect themselves from bullies from their previous
    lives while simultaneously working on healing themselves. More than
    anything, these women need the support of a trusted community and access to
    resources that can provide them new economic opportunities.
</p>
<p>
That is where organizations like <a href="https://www.shynesd.org/">Shyne SD</a> come in. And that is why I
    have pledged my support to Shyne SD as they strengthen their network of
    survivor businesswomen. My volunteering is through an organization called
    <a href="https://www.wakeinternational.org/tech2empower-usa">
        Tech2Empower
    </a>
    that matches advisors to causes that they care about. My work with Shyne SD
    through Tech2Empower is slated to last only the next few weeks, but I am
    moved by stories like Monica's to know that we need to continue supporting
    them. Human trafficking is a violation of human rights and a social justice issue. 
    It deprives the world of so much potential and deprives people trapped in it in unimaginable ways. 
</p>
<p>
    So, my ask of you is this: learn more about survivors of abuse. A very good
    way to do that is to look for organizations like Shyne SD and get to know
    the survivors better. There is nothing like firsthand stories to help you
    learn about an issue deeply. And if you have a few dollars or hours to
    spare, please donate to Shyne SD or other organizations that support
    survivors. Every single dollar and hour you give makes a difference. Mother
    Theresa once said that "if you cannot feed the world, feed a single
    person". We may not be able to eliminate evil from the world, but we can
    definitely make a difference.
