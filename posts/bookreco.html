title: 20 books from 20+ years of reading
date: June 08, 2024
---
<p>
    I was not an early reader. When I was little, life was difficult, money
    was scarce, and there was not a lot of opportunity  for
    recreational book reading.
</p>

<p>
    After immigrating to Canada, I found myself suddenly in a world  of
    abundance – I still remember my disbelief mixed with glee when I first went
    to  a public library. I started reading ravenously. It was almost as though
    I was  making up for my first two decades of not being a reader. I would
    read when  having coffee, read at lunch, read in the evenings when others in
    the house watched  TV, read in bed, even read on my way to college. I
    confess I continue to do  most of that even today.
</p>

<p>
    Reading is still my favorite pastime, a steady companion,  something that
    has seen me through boredom and loneliness and turmoil and grief.  It has
    helped me grow as a human, taught me to be philosophical, honed my
    leadership skills, shined light on human nature, made me marvel at the magic
    of  the world, helped me take care of myself. These days I read books but
    also  listen to them when I am cooking or when I am out running. There are
    so many  ways to open your mind and learn through reading, so if you are not
    reading a  book or two every few months, I urge you to give this fabulous
    habit a try. You  might fall in love just as I did.

    Here are 20 book recommendations from my more than 20 years  of reading.
</p>
<p>
    1.
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Room-Ones-Own-Virginia-Woolf-ebook/dp/B0BXDT3MZZ/"
    >
        A  Room of One’s Own
    </a>
    : A feminist classic with beautiful writing, this book’s  premise is that
    one needs space (physical and mental) and stability to find her  own voice.
    I read this for the first time when I was in my early 20s. It was
    empowering,  a call to claim my space in the world and share my voice.
</p>
<p>

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful-ebook/dp/B07WF972WK"
    >
        The  7 Habits of Highly Effective People
    </a>
    : Unlike preachy self-help books,  Covey’s thoughtful approach encourages
    prioritizing the important and not  getting drowned in the urgent, defining
    what success means to you, and seeking to  understand others before trying
    to be understood. It’s packed with valuable  leadership and personal
    lessons.
</p>

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi-ebook/dp/B00XSSYR50"
    >
        When  Breath Becomes Air
    </a>
    : I don’t often reread books – there are so many books  out there that I
    find it hard to justify going back to something I have already  read. This
    one is an exception. I read this book a few years ago, and I was  moved by
    the poignancy of the writing. It’s a deeply touching memoir of Dr. Paul
    Kalanidhi, a neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He
    explores the meaning of life as he his own death draws nearer. Strange as it
    might  sound, rereading this after my dad passed away gave me much solace
    and appreciation  for the impermanence of life.

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates-ebook/dp/B004P1JDJO"
    >
        Drive:  The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us
    </a>
    : I was training in Computer  Science through college. When I became a
    developer, I could immediately put my  training to use. But when I became a
    manager, no part of my schooling helped me  with understanding human
    motivation. This is where books like Drive come in. In  this book, Pink’s
    thesis is that humans are not just motivated by external  rewards like
    money. Some of the powerful things that drive us are intrinsic,  such as
    autonomy, mastery of a craft, and meaning in work. Over a dozen years  of
    people management now, I’ve used these insights to help my teams thrive.

    >
        The  Elements of Style
    </a>
    : Every writer should read this. Everyone that needs to  write – and that is
    EVERYONE – should read this. “Use strong, concrete words to  convey your
    ideas effectively”, “Omit needless words”, “Avoid complex negations  in a
    sentence” are all great advice that apply now as in 1919 when this book  was
    published.

    >
        Miles  from Nowhere
    </a>
    : I was not going to do the monthlong bicycle trip along the  Pacific coast
    from Vancouver to California with my husband. I was too nervous. I  imagined
    all the possible ways it could go wrong. One day as we were still  arguing
    about whether to go or not, my husband cleverly left a copy of this  book on
    our dining table, and I picked it up to read. It was a captivating tale.  In
    the book, the author goes on a 23,000 KM global journey on her bicycle,
    visiting 25 countries. I loved the stories and was mesmerized by the
    adventure.  I changed my mind on the trip – spoiler alert: our Pacific coast
    bicycle trip  was one of the most cherished memories of my life. Read it if
    you would like to  see for yourself what it feels like to answer the call of
    slow travel.

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Outlive-Science-Longevity-Peter-Attia-ebook/dp/B0B1BTJLJN"
    >
        Outlive:  The Science and Art of Longevity
    </a>
    : Dr. Peter Attia’s analytical prowess  shines in his book, with every claim
    backed by scientific reasoning. I read  this book while mourning my father’s
    death in 2024, a life claimed by one of  the ‘four horsemen’ (heart disease,
    cancer, type 2 diabetes, and  neurodegenerative disease) that Dr. Attia
    warns us about. Despite his seemingly  extreme ideas, the book is a treasure
    trove of insights for enhancing life  quality in old age.

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari-ebook/dp/B00ICN066A"
    >
        Sapiens:  A Brief History of Humankind
    </a>
    : My husband jokes that Yuval Noah Harari is  one of the two author crushes
    I have - I drop his name in my conversations so  much. This book blew my
    mind. History is drab for most people, and the history  of all of humankind
    can strike you as a boring read. But the way Harari spins  this yarn, he has
    you turning the pages. Here is a thought-provoking concept  for you from the
    book: most things we consider real and base our daily lives on  – money,
    religion, government, laws – are not real. They exist because humans
    conjured them as ideas and these ideas stuck with a large group of people. I
    can’t think of money the same way ever again.

    9.
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA"
    >
        Thinking  Fast and Slow
    </a>
    : Continuing with my author crushes, Daniel Kahneman. Kahneman  is a
    brilliant behavioral scientist who made me (and millions of others) aware
    of the quirks and biases in our one head. He talks about the fast “System 1”
    in  your brain that you often use to make snap decisions and the more
    deliberate “System  2” that you need to use for complex tasks and problems.
    System 1 being fast is  great, but can also land us in trouble because it
    gets trapped in illusions and  biases. This book is a bible for anyone who
    wants to understand how their own  mind – or another human’s – works.

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins-ebook/dp/B003JTHWJQ"
    >
        The  God Delusion
    </a>
    : There was a time in my life when, thanks to being brought up  in an
    orthodox family, I was super religious. It is because of scientists like
    Richard Dawkins that I began to question my own superstitions and delusions.
    Dawkins is most certainly a controversial figure, someone who virulently
    criticizes  organized religion. But if you can put aside his rhetoric and
    just try to learn  from his arguments, this would is a thought-provoking
    read.

    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself-ebook/dp/B003TU29WA"
    >
        The  Untethered Soul
    </a>
    : This is a strange recommendation to follow the one about “delusion”.  In
    this book, Michael Singer talks about some things that are most definitely
    outlandish and strain your logical mind. But there is one concept that has
    really helped me and that is the only reason this book in in my list: what
    we  understand as ‘self’ – our constant stream of thoughts and emotions – is
    neither  a constant nor our true self. It is our consciousness that keeps us
    alive that remains  constant (even though that too is a
    <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/beingyou">
        ’controlled  hallucination’ of our minds
    </a>
    ). The more often you pull yourself back into  that consciousness rather
    than operating in the realm of thought and emotions,  the more peace and
    balance you’ll find.

        href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Life-Full-Family-Future-ebook/dp/B08YN8H8GF"
    >
        My  Life in Full
    </a>
    : This book is not only a beautiful read, but inspiring too. Indra  Nooyi
    is a legend, a great leader, and a wonderful writer. This book chronicles
    her journey from her childhood in India, her education at Yale, to her rise
    as  one of the world's most powerful businesswomen. Nooyi shares her
    insights on  leadership, career growth, work-life balance, and the role of
    diversity in the  workforce.

    >
        Big  Magic
    </a>
    : Elizabeth Gilbert writes splendidly, but I have to confess: I always  have
    a love-hate relationship with her books. I gave up and went back to Eat,
    Pray, Love at least a handful of times. Her woo-woo turns me away, but her
    style  and lyrical writing bring me back to her books. Big Magic was mostly
    in the “love”  territory for me. Here is one of my highlights in the book:
    “We all spend our  twenties and thirties trying so hard to be perfect,
    because we’re so worried  about what people will think of us. Then we get
    into our forties and fifties,  and we finally start to be free, because we
    decide that we don’t give a damn  what anyone thinks of us. But you won’t be
    completely free until you reach your  sixties and seventies, when you
    finally realize this liberating truth—nobody  was ever thinking about you,
    anyhow.”

    >
        Becoming
    </a>
    :  Becoming is Michelle Obama’s memoir. I loved the intimacy, honesty, the
    relatability  and sheer beauty of her writing. She says, “I belonged at
    Princeton, as much as  anybody. And I came from the South Side of Chicago.
    It felt important to say  out loud.” As someone that comes from a no-name
    town in the South of India, I  can totally understand this feeling of
    wanting to say to every minority listening  that we belong no matter
    whatever stories are, no matter where we come from.  Hats off to Obama for
    saying this so eloquently.

    >
        Walden
    </a>
    :  This book is a ponderous read, but full of brilliant ideas. Thoreau
    critiques  our tendency to materialism and calls on us to connect with
    nature more. If you  think this is just some hermetic weirdo’s idea, think
    again. There is a lot of  scientific evidence to the benefits of being in
    the woods/nature. Reading this  not only helps us explore non-materialism
    but also kindles a desire to be  outdoors more.
</p>

    >
        Four  Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals
    </a>
    : Embracing your limits – now that’s  a foreign concept for many of us. But
    Oliver Burkeman argues that there is no  other way to live your life. We are
    limited in many ways – what our bodies can  do, how many days we have on
    earth, what can truly remain after we are gone. Paradoxically  the way to a
    tranquil and productive life is to accept these limits and focus on  doing
    the next right thing. I love this book so much

        Reading  Lolita in Tehran
    </a>
    : At the heart of this book is Nafisi’s secret book club,  which she hosted
    during her last two years in Iran. The club, consisting of a  handpicked
    group of female former students, met weekly at Nafisi’s house to  discuss
    forbidden Western classics. They read and discussed works of English
    literature, with particular importance placed on the works of Vladimir
    Nabokov,  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Jane Austen. The book is a
    reminder of  the power of books to empower and inspire.

        Life of  Pi
    </a>
    : What makes this novel stand out in my memory is its beautiful,
    philosophical  ending. I won’t give away any spoilers, but just saw that it
    is spectacular and  unique tale through and through.

        A  Game of Thrones
    </a>
    : Don’t judge me, but I am OBSESSED with this series. I  watch it on HBO
    repeatedly and never get bored. Teading these books was a sheer  joy. Don’t
    let their length deter you. The book series brims with political intrigue,
    medieval imagery, battles, strong women leaders, magic, passion, betrayal
    and  so much more. And then, of course, there are dragons –how can you say
    no to  that! 😊

    >
        The  Pillars of the Earth
    </a>
    : If I remember right, The Pillars was my introduction  to historical
    fiction, and this is a genre that has captivated me now. The book  is
    meticulously researched and detailed, and yet a delightful page turner. It
    is set in medieval England and explores commerce, religion, and politics of
    the  era through its most memorable characters.

        Man’s  search for meaning
    </a>
    : Ok, I said 20 recommendations, but I can’t end the list  without this one.
    This was the last book that my father gifted me and I will  cherish it for
    just that fact. But this book is more than that. Here are couple  of
    profound quotes from Frankl to end this post with.
</p>
<p>
    “Forces beyond your control can take away everything you  possess except one
    thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the  situation. You
    cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always  control what
    you will feel and do about what happens to you.”
</p>
<p>
    “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a  target, the more
    you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot  be pursued;
    it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of  one’s
    dedication to a cause greater than oneself.”
</p>
