title: And she lived happily ever after
date: March 19, 2022
---
<p>
    My brother, in the thick of an argument, once remarked that I have had a
    "fairy tale" life. You see, my brother and I inhabited the same house for
    fewer than a couple of years when we were growing up. He lived with my dad and I lived with 
    various relatives at different times. We hardly know each
    other. Though I love him as my flesh and blood, he is 180 degrees from me
    politically, philosophically, and emotionally.
</p>
<p>
    My brother is a smart man. He is right in thinking that my life appears to
    be a fairy tale. A girl is born into a middle-class family. Her father
    dotes on her, calls her the apple of his eye, the sinews of his heart. 
    She does well academically. She is encouraged by all around her to
    study more, praised for her scholarly aptitude. Her Prince Charming arrives
    one day and whisks her off to a fine country. She gets more educated, gets
    hired by a top software company. She progresses in her career and becomes
    successful, earning more wealth than her father and many of her relatives
    put together.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, in fact, it is a sweet story. And I am very thankful for the
    privileges and opportunities I have had in my life that have enabled such a story. 
    I was born to a man that believed in higher
    education for girls, not just boys. I was born in an era when girls could go to school, not 
    get married off at eight like my grandmothers. I belonged to a family with generations
    of grounding in academics and adequate cash reserves. 
    Even though I lost my mother before I knew who I was, I had people around me 
    with a sense of duty to take care of a motherless child in their family.
    I married a man that believes in equality, that supports me endlessly in my
    various pursuits.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks to the civil rights movement of the sixties, I could emigrate to a
    country where I could access more opportunities. Even as an immigrant, an
    outsider, I could still make something of myself, feel free enough and
    brave enough to try on new identities.  
    I chanced upon an opportunity at Microsoft that has
    gone on to enrich my life in so many ways. I have chosen not to have
    children, which in turn has opened up time and resources that I could use
    for my side interests and travels. These travels and side interests have made my life colorful beyond my imagination.
</p>
<p>
    My mother couldn't have dreamed of such a trajectory in her own life. The
    architecture of opportunities in her lifetime was limited for someone of
    her class and gender. I was born in the late seventies. Women of my
    generation, both in India and in the United States, have seen an ascendancy
    of choices. We have been able to get educated, have careers, become
    executives, choose when to have children and how many to have, be equal partners in
    our marriages, be bold and ambitious with our lives and work. So yes, it is
    a fairy tale of sorts. I understand that's what is most visible, what's most on
    the surface.
</p>
<p>
    But here is what is not so visible. Here are a few things that have
    happened in my life, as a girl growing up in the eighties and nineties, and
    as a woman ever since. Things that, had I been of a different class,
    color, gender, place of birth, arguably I might not have had to face.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    When I was growing up, boys and men have heckled at me in my neighborhood and in school.
    Sometimes I have wondered at the objective of this catcalling. Did these
    men seriously think they could attract a girl/woman by mouthing prurient comments
    at her? Some of these boys felt bold enough to not just stop at
    heckling. They exposed themselves, groped girls, assaulted us when no one
    was around. I had always felt ashamed when something like this happened,
    though in hindsight, it should have been these boys that should have been
    ashamed of their behavior. 
</li>
<li>
    While the families I lived with in my early life were never poor, they
    still struggled. We could buy bananas, but apples and oranges
    were a luxury. We ate three meals a day, but second-helpings were
    not ok, especially for an outsider in the family, me. I used rags that had to be washed 
    every month because we couldn't afford sanitary pads. I used a chalkboard to work out my sums so 
    I wouldn't waste paper.
</li>
<li>
    I was told many times, in multiple households, to "stop with the studies
    and come help in the kitchen" instead. The men in my family, including my
    brother, could leave their dirty dinner plates on the table and walk away
    to their study rooms. The womenfolk of the house, including me, were expected to clean
    up.
</li>
<li>
    One of my colleagues in engineering college told me that I should not
    apply for a job at the campus interviews since I would be taking away a man's job and that man
    needed the job more. Mind you, this interaction happened in 1998,
    not in 1898, and the person who told me this was an educated free-thinking
    man of the nineties.
</li>
<li>
    Later in life, in corporate America, a male colleague once advised me to dress in skirts and
    wear makeup so I would look more feminine. Faded jeans and baggy shirts
    were ok for my male coworkers, but somehow not adequate for me. When I did
    end up on a stage for a keynote, the man I co-presented with had his "stage
    makeup" done in five minutes by the makeup crew, while mine took close to
    an hour. It appeared to me that, as a woman, it's not just what I said that
    mattered, but also how I looked when I said it.
</li>
<li>
    Regardless of where I am in my professional life, at home, my 
    family still thinks of me as the default cook and caretaker. If we have a
    family gathering, e.g., the women in the house are expected to take charge of the
    meals and the coffee. Cooking and cleaning are not for the men of the
    family. My husband often gets hustled out of the kitchen if he comes
    in to help. He is not supposed to do "woman's work".
</li>
<li>
    My father, who has always had high expectations for me and who has always
    encouraged me in excelling at whatever I do, told me once that I should
    have a career only if my husband allowed it. He wanted me to get
    married as soon as I left college so I would be "protected" when I moved to
    America to study further. I understand the protective instinct he had - refer 
    back to the comment on the neighborhood catcalling and the groping. It was scary to be an "unprotected girl". 
    My brother and male cousins, on the other hand,
    could safely stay single and focus on their work well into their post-docs before
    getting hitched. 
</li>

<li>
    I have walked into corporate meeting rooms where I have been told that I was not "senior enough" to attend  when I had actually been 
    the most senior person in that group. I have been in international meetings where 
    every question I asked was met with an answer directed at a male member of my delegation. It was 
    almost as if I didn't exist in those rooms!
</li>
<li>
    While I am fortunate to work for a company that truly wants to make tech
    a vibrant and diverse workplace, many conference rooms are still filled with men
    that don't speak like me, look like me, or are from backgrounds like mine.
    I work hard to keep the feeling of not belonging at bay. I work hard to get things 
    done, often dancing a delicate dance between being assertive while not being labeled aggressive, being 
    results-driven while not being perceived as impatient. I work hard to get
    my voice heard and amplify the voices of minorities like me. 
</li>

</ol>
<p>
    Despite all this, 
    I got enough breaks in my life for upward mobility to be possible. But I know that's not
     the case for every young woman or girl around the globe. Don't get me wrong. The progress we have made through generations in addressing various
    indignities and inequalities - based on gender, class, race, accent, place
    of birth and so on - has indeed been inspiring. But, no, it is not a fairy tale just
    yet. There are everyday struggles, aggressions, and inequities a number of
    us face constantly to this day. There is still more work to do before we
    can live happily ever after.
</p>
<p>
    I hope that every year brings more progress, and most importantly, does not
    take us back on the path we have come so far on. Happy Women's History Month.
