<p>
    I sit with a gaping hole in my heart
    But I know it is not empty
    It is filled with his love and his spirit
    That live on in me.
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>He is gone from this world
    But he is not gone from my life
    He is in every memory and every moment
    That I cherish and hold tight.</p>
<p>
    All meaning is lost,
    Gone with him
    Into the roiling waves of the Bay of Bengal
    Where we tossed his ashes and bones.
    I need to find my meaning once more, recreate it
    Recreate it because that&rsquo;s what he would want me to do&hellip;
    I know it is not lost
    It is in his legacy and his values
    That he taught me all his life
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    My handsome daddy
    Who had a love for me
    As pure as the morning snow on Mount Fuji
    As luminous as the light of a blue star
    As comforting as a woolen blanket
    on a cold winter afternoon
    As ever-present as my own breath.</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    My daddy, whose heart was full of kindness
    Whose head was full of ideas
    My daddy, whose passing hurts me
    Like nothing has ever hurt me
    My daddy who was the greatest gift
    Of my early life
    What a lucky girl I am
    To be loved so unconditionally by him
    To be loved so by a man like him.
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I sit in a caf&eacute;, buttering my croissant
    Stirring my warm coffee
    And there they come&hellip;
    The menories, the pain
    The feeling of being bereft
    Like nothing matters now
    Not accolades, not achievements, not riches
    Why would they, when I can share them
    With him no more.
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I ask myself a million times
    How could he die so soon?
    How could he not be in this world anymore?
    How could I live without hearing his laughter
    Without saying a million inanities to each other
    How? How? How?
    I can find no answer in my weeping heart.
