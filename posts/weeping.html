<p>
    I sit with a gaping hole in my heart</p>
<p>
    But I know it is not empty</p>
<p>
    It is filled with his love and his spirit</p>
<p>
    That live on in me.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>He is gone from this world</p>
<p>
    But he is not gone from my life</p>
<p>
    He is in every memory and every moment</p>
<p>
    That I cherish and hold tight.</p>
<p>
    All meaning is lost</p>
<p>
    Gone with him</p>
<p>
    Into the roiling waves of the Bay of Bengal</p>
<p>
    Where we tossed his ashes and bones</p>
<p>
    I need to find my meaning once more, recreate it</p>
<p>
    Recreate it because that&rsquo;s what he would want me to do&hellip;
    I know it is not lost</p>
<p>
    It is in his legacy and his values</p>
<p>
    That he taught me all his life.</p>
    <p>

<p>
    My handsome daddy</p>
<p>
    Who had a love for me</p>
<p>
    As pure as the morning snow on Mount Fuji</p>
<p>
    As luminous as the light of a blue star</p>
<p>
    As comforting as a woolen blanket</p>
<p>
    on a cold winter afternoon</p>
<p>
    As ever-present as my own breath.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    My daddy, whose heart was full of kindness</p>
<p>
    Whose head was full of ideas</p>
<p>
    My daddy, whose passing hurts me</p>
<p>
    Like nothing has ever hurt me</p>
<p>
    My daddy who was the greatest gift</p>
<p>
    Of my early life</p>
<p>
    What a lucky girl I am</p>
<p>
    To be loved so unconditionally by him</p>
<p>
    To be loved so by a man like him.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I sit in a caf&eacute;, buttering my croissant</p>
<p>
    Stirring my warm coffee</p>
<p>
    And there they come&hellip;</p>
<p>
    The menories, the pain</p>
<p>
    The feeling of being bereft</p>
<p>
    Like nothing matters now</p>
<p>
    Not accolades, not achievements, not riches</p>
<p>
    Why would they, when I can share them</p>
<p>
    With him no more.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I ask myself a million times</p>
<p>
    How could he die so soon?</p>
<p>
    How could he not be in this world anymore?</p>
<p>
    How could I live without hearing his laughter</p>
<p>
    Without saying a million inanities to each other</p>
<p>
    How? How? How?</p>
<p>
    I can find no answer in my weeping heart.</p>
