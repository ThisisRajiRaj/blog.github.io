title: There are two types of speakers...

<p>
    I recently watched "The Darkest Hour", a movie about some crucial events of World War II. 
    In it, there is a moment
    when Churchill's political career AND the fate of the allied countries seem
    poised on a knife's edge. The members of the British parliament have lost faith in
    his direction. At that exact moment, Churchill rises from his seat and
    makes a rousing speech. Like the viewers of the movie, his colleagues are
    moved and energized. They pledge their support to him. The army is mobilized, and the rest is history.
    At the end of that scene, one of Churchill's colleagues remarks that
    Churchill had just "mobilized the English language and sent it into
    battle".
</p>
<p>
    Here is a less well-known fact about Churchill, the man who was famous for his words and speeches. In his first 
    ever speech to the parliament, he froze for a full three minutes, then mutterered a few words 
    before sitting down. Many of us similarly struggle with speaking in public. Speaking
    well can help you have greater impact on the world. It can help you
    persuade others to make things happen. It can help your career. So how can one become a better public speaker?
</p>

<p>
    After my earlier <a href="https://rajiraj.com/blog/traps">blog post on Thinking Traps</a>, 
    a few folks reached out to me with that question. I promised
        that I'd write up what I had learned myself over the years and share.

    Public speaking doesn't come naturally to me. When I started in this
    industry, I had six years of training in computer science but little
    understanding of how to communicate well. For the first few years, my work
    had been all about my code. I was expected to collaborate with others but
    speaking to groups of people was not expected. Very soon though - and much
    sooner than one might expect - expectations started to shift. As a senior
    engineer and then as a manager, communicating clearly and confidently
    became important. Then, I started presenting to customers and to the leaders of my company. 
</p>
<p>
    I have had the good fortune of working at a company that invests in its
    employees. Microsoft gave me a ton of resources - 1:1 presentation
    coaching, useful feedback from managers, free LinkedIn Learning
    courses - that I used to learn the art of public speaking. So here is what I learned.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    Let's start with the "what".
</h5>

<p>
    <b>Openings are important</b> - not just for your speech, but for any content.
    Whether it is an email to your team or a novel you read or a movie you
    watch, openings can make or break the deal. Try to capture the attention of
    your audience with your opening. With so many flashy things that vie for
    everyone's attention these days, getting your audience quickly interested is
    crucial.

</p>
<p>
<b>Tell a story</b>. A lot of what we present in our day jobs can feel like
    disparate sets of facts and figures. But there is always a human story to
    tell. There is always a narrative, a story arc, that you can weave. It
    could be from the perspective of a single customer. It could be a grand end
    vision you are painting for your area. Find the right story arc, especially
    one that speaks in the currency of your listener's heart.
</p>
<p>
    If you are using slides, <b>do not cram them with words</b>. It is almost
    impossible for people to pay attention to multiple things simultaneously.
    If your slides have too many words, your audience is spending their
    attention on parsing them and not on listening to you. A single picture is
    not just worth a thousand words, it can also anchor your audience's
    attention.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    Now about the "how" of your presentationâ€¦
</h5>

</br>
<p>
    The biggest favor you can do to yourself, and your audience, is to <b>slowwwww
    the heck down</b>. When I was given this feedback myself, many times, I would
    think that I had slowed down only to realize that I had not *actually*
    slowed down, or I had not slowed down enough. The time it takes in a group
    setting for your audience to follow you tends to be way more than you
    realize. Slowing down and pausing between words helps your listeners
    cognitively catch up with you.
</p>
<p>
    Slowing down also helps you. You tend to speak faster when you are nervous,
    but speaking fast makes you breathe shallower, and consequently more
    nervous. This endless vicious cycle can be interrupted if you just pause
    and take breaths. Doing so brought the biggest improvement by far in my
    public speaking. I ended up coming across more confident and, because I was
    not increasing my anxiety with ragged breaths, I was able to think more
    calmly as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Use short sentences</b> to further reduce the cognitive strain for your
    audience. Additionally, do not run on with your points. We tend to be
    subject matter experts in what we are speaking and therefore we suffer from
    what is called the "knowledge curse". Knowledge curse makes it difficult
    for experts to explain things clearly and concisely to people they
    communicate with. It makes you unfocused - your head crammed with so many
    things you want to convey at once - and you start rambling. Make your
    point, succinctly, and move on to the next point you want to make.
</p>
<p>
<b>Empathize and connect with your audience</b>. Know what your audience's
    background is beforehand and speak to their heart as well as their brains.
    Understand what they are looking for and what makes their world go around.
    Make eye contact. Talk to a single person in the front row and sustain your
    gaze for a couple of seconds before moving to the next person in the
    audience.
</p>
<p>
    Calm your pre-talk jitters with deep breathing and affirmations that work
    for you. For example, you could say to yourself, "These are my people. They
    are rooting for me to do well". Instead of saying "I am nervous", tell
    yourself that you feel excited to be there.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, <b>be authentic</b>. The worst you can do is try to be somebody else.
    Perhaps you admire someone who is naturally funny and jokes in all their
    talks. Perhaps you want your audience to laugh as well. But don't try to
    add in jokes if that is not your style. One of my friends once told me that
    she feels like she is listening to a professor when she in one of my talks.
    Whereas her own speaking style makes me feel more like I am listening to a
    no-nonsense older sister. I adore my friend's style, but it's not for me.
    Instead of trying to be her, if I tried to be the best possible me, I would
    end up being more authentic for my audience.
</p>
<p>
    In summary:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    Slow down. Pause more than you think you should.
</li>
<li>
    Breathe. Take mindful breaths before you begin. Take more mindful
    breaths when you pause.
</li>
<li>
    Find the story in what you want to say and stick to that story arc. Do
    not be verbose in your speech or in your slides.
</li>
<li>
    Connect with your audience. Understand the currency of their heart.
</li>
<li>
    Be true to yourself and your style.
</li>
<li>
    Smile. Calm your nerves using affirmations and by giving yourself the
    permission to be imperfect.
</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p>
    After all these years, it is still an effort for me to get up on stage and
    talk. It still makes me uncomfortable and anxious. I make  mistakes and struggle 
    to follow the advice above. But all of 
    that is ok. Many good leaders I know experience the same. None of them are
    perfect all the time. Perfection, in
    my view, is an elusive and a needless goal in many areas of life.  Show yourself the compassion to challenge the
    tyranny of perfection. Good luck!
